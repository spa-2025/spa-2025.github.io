For the quadratic transport cost, estimates will be given in terms of weak-dependent coefficients that are well suited to a large class of dependent sequences. This class includes irreducible Markov chains, dynamical systems generated by intermittent maps or strong mixing sequences. We will also present very recent results in the independent framework for a broader class of convex costs that includes quadratic cost as a special case but also certain logarithmic costs such as \\(|x| \\ln (1+ |x|)\\).

These characteristics introduce significant challenges to traditional option pricing methodologies. Addressing these complexities requires advanced models that can effectively capture the dynamics of the market. We explore which option pricing models are most effective in valuing cryptocurrency options. Specifically, we calibrate and evaluate the performance of the Black—Scholes, Merton Jump Diffusion, Variance Gamma, Kou, Heston, and Bates models. Our analysis focuses on pricing vanilla options on futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). We find that the Black–Scholes model exhibits the highest pricing errors. In contrast, the Kou and Bates models achieve the lowest errors, with the Kou model performing the best for the BTC options and the Bates model for ETH options. The results highlight the importance of incorporating jumps and stochastic volatility into pricing models to better reflect the behavior of these assets. P3: Fractional Brownian motions with random Hurst exponent Hubert Woszczek (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) stand: S3 We present several results concerning two types of fractional Brownian motions with a random Hurst exponent, which are inspired by recent biological experiments in single particle tracking. In both cases, we introduce basic probabilistic properties such as the q-th moment of the absolute value of the process, the autocovariance function, and the expectation of the time-averaged mean squared displacement. Furthermore, we analyze the ergodic properties of both processes. Alongside the theoretical analysis, we also provide a numerical study of the results. The poster is based on the results of \\([1]\\).

P4: Solution to Stochastic Loewner Equation with Several Complex Variables using Nevanlinna Theory Andrej Srakar (University of Ljubljana) stand: S4 Becker (1973) studied solutions to the Loewner differential equation in one complex variable using Carathéodory class of holomorphic functions. However, in several complex variables point singularities are removable and other approaches necessary. Pfaltzgraff generalized to higher dimensions the Loewner differential equation and developed existence and uniqueness theorems for its solutions. The existence and regularity theory has been considered by several authors, and applications given to the characterization of subclasses of biholomorphic mappings, univalence criteria, growth theorems and coefficient bounds for restricted classes of biholomorphic mappings. Duren et al. (2010) studied general form of solutions to the Loewner differential equation under common assumptions of holomorphicity and uniquely determined univalent subordination chains. To our knowledge, to date stochastic Loewner equation has not been studied in a several complex variable setting. We solve the equation in its ordinary and partial differential form by firstly appropriately defining Brownian motion in high dimensions, following Pitman and Yor (2018). We translate the problem in meromorphic form using generalizations of Nevanlinna theory for several complex variables (Noguchi and Winkelman, 2013) and previous work on invariance in the connections of Nevanlinna theory and stochastic processes (e.g. Atsuji, 1995). Finally, the equation is solved using general techniques from rough paths theory (see e.g. Hairer, 2013) and complex Feynman-Kac theorem (see e.g. Grothaus et al., 2010; Xu, 2015). Our solution allows to study stochastic phenomena such as Schramm-Loewner evolution in high dimensions (d&gt;2) which answers one of important present open issues in probability theory and random geometry in particular. We shortly discuss convergence to a scaling limit for multidimensional lattice models as a power series problem on Hartogs domain. Connection between Nevanlinna theory in several complex variables and high-dimensional Brownian motions promises to provide a path to solving stochastic differential equations with several complex variables, which is at present an unaddressed issue in probability theory. P5: Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type strong law of large numbers for supOU processes Danijel Grahovac (University of Osijek, Croatia) stand: S5 Superpositions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes (supOU) form a versatile class of infinitely divisible stationary stochastic processes. These processes allow for independent modeling of the marginal distribution and the dependence structure. We present results on the almost sure growth of integrated supOU processes, establishing a Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type strong law of large numbers. Unlike the classical version, the critical moment condition in our results depends not only on the finiteness of moments but also on the strength of dependence. We further explore connections to weak limit theorems and demonstrate that the derived growth rates are optimal. Integrated supOU processes may exhibit intermittency, characterized by higher-order moments growing faster than predicted by limit theorems. However, our results demonstrate that large peaks, despite the unusual growth of moments, do not occur infinitely often. We also discuss possible extensions to mixed moving average processes. The results presented are part of joint work with Péter Kevei (University of Szeged, Hungary), Nikolai N. Leonenko (Cardiff University, UK) and Murad S. Taqqu (Boston University, USA).

All three heavy-tailed Pearson diffusions, having inverse gamma, Fisher-Snedecor (\\(F\\)) and Student stationary distributions, can be constructed via an absolutely continuous time-change employed in a specific functional transformation of CIR or OU process. Moreover, time-change rates in stochastic clocks are continuous functionals of the CIR process. \\(F\\)-diffusion, heavy-tailed Pearson diffusion with a stationary \\(F\\) distribution, is derived from the bivariate CIR process \\(\\left( X_{1}(t), X_{2}(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) given by SDE \\[\\tag{1} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} dX_{1}(t) = -b \\left( X_{1}(t) - \\beta_{1} \\right) \\, dt + \\sqrt{c X_{1}(t)} \\, dW_{1}(t) \\\\ dX_{2}(t) = -b \\left( X_{2}(t) - \\beta_{2} \\right) \\, dt + \\sqrt{c X_{2}(t)} \\, dW_{2}(t), \\end{array} \\right.\\] where \\(\\left( W_{1}(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) and \\(\\left( W_{2}(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) are independent standard Brownian motions. The parameters \\(\\beta_{1}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) are positive and not necessarily identical, while parameters \\(b &gt; 0\\) and \\(c &gt; 0\\), governing the speed of the mean reversion and volatility, are identical in both univariate CIRs. The motivation for defining the functional transformation of \\(\\left( X_{1}(t), X_{2}(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) comes from the relationship between two independent gamma distributions and the \\(F\\)-distribution. In particular, if \\(X_{1} \\sim \\Gamma(\\alpha \\beta_{1}, \\alpha)\\) and \\(X_{2} \\sim \\Gamma(\\alpha \\beta_{2}, \\alpha)\\) are independent, where \\(\\alpha = 2b/c\\) and \\(\\beta_{2}, b, c &gt; 0\\), then the random variable \\(Y = \\beta_{2} X_{1}/\\beta_{1} X_{2}\\) has an \\(F\\) distribution with shape parameters \\(2\\alpha\\beta_{1}\\) and \\(2\\alpha\\beta_{2}\\), denoted by \\(Y \\sim F(2\\alpha\\beta_{1}, 2\\alpha\\beta_{2})\\). The procedure for construction of time-changed \\(F\\)-diffusion is given in the following proposition. Proposition. Let \\(\\left( X_{1}(t), X_{2}(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) be a two-dimensional CIR process with independent components given by SDE \\((1)\\), satisfying the condition \\(\\beta_{2} &gt; (c/b) \\max\\{1, c/2\\}\\), and let \\(\\left( Y_{1}(t), Y_{2}(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) be its functional, given as follows: \\[Y_{1}(t) = \\displaystyle\\frac{X_{1}(t)}{X_{2}(t)}, \\quad Y_{2}(t) = X_{2}(t).\\] If the time-change process \\(\\left( T(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) is defined as \\[T(t) = \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{1}{Y_{2}(s)} \\, ds,\\] then it has continuous inverse \\((\\tau_{t})_{t \\geq 0}\\) given by \\[\\tau_{t}(\\omega) = \\tau(t, \\omega) = \\inf{\\{s \\geq 0: T_{t} &gt; t\\}},\\] and \\(\\left( Y_{1}(\\tau_{t}) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\) is \\(F\\)-diffusion driven by the Brownian motion \\[\\widetilde{W}^{*}_{1}(t) = \\displaystyle\\int_{0}^{\\tau_{t}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{Y_{2}(s)}} \\, d\\widetilde{W}_{1}(s), \\\\ \\widetilde{W}_{1}(t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 Y_{2}(t)}{Y_{1}(t) \\left( Y_{1}(t) + 4 \\right)}} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{Y_{1}(t)}{Y_{2}(t)}} W_{1}(t) - \\sqrt{\\frac{Y_{1}^{2}(t)}{4 Y_{2}(t)}} W_{2}(t) \\right),\\] where \\(\\left( W_{i}(t) \\right)_{t \\geq 0}\\), \\(i = 1, 2\\), are independent standard Brownian motions driving process \\((1)\\).

P7: Doubly stochastic resetting Kacper Taźbierski (WUST) stand: S7 Stochastic resetting is a very potent branch of stochastic processes. It can model sudden (or not!) returns of the process or some of its properties to their initial state. One of the forms of stochastic resetting is the so-called partial resetting, where at the moment of the reset the value of the process changes according to the rule \\(X(\\tau)= c X(\\tau^-)\\), \\(c\\in [0,1]\\), and the process loses its memory. We will discuss the problems of complete and memory resetting, which are the special cases where \\(c=0\\) and \\(c=1\\). The main focus is put on the case where the resetting mechanism is guided by a Cox process. There, some interesting anomalous diffusion properties emerge. Theorem 1. \\([1]\\) Let the underlying stochastic process \\(X(t)\\) display anomalous diffusion with exponent \\(\\alpha\\) for large times and a memory resetting mechanism be guided by a mixed Poisson process with random intensity \\(R\\) and PDF displaying power law \\(p_R(r)\\stackrel{r\\downarrow 0}{\\sim}L(r)r^{\\varrho-1}\\). Here \\(L\\) is a slowly varying function and \\(\\varrho&gt;0\\). Then the process under resetting displays anomalous behavior with exponent \\(\\alpha-\\varrho\\) if \\(\\varrho&lt;\\alpha-1\\) and normal diffusion otherwise. Theorem 2. \\([2]\\) Let the underlying stochastic process \\(X(t)\\) display anomalous diffusion with exponent \\(\\alpha\\) for large times and a complete resetting mechanism be guided by a Cox process with random intensity function \\(r(t)\\) scaling like \\(t^{\\varrho-1}\\) for \\(\\varrho&gt;0\\). Then the process under resetting displays anomalous behavior with exponent \\(\\alpha(1-\\varrho)\\). Bibliography \\([1]\\) Taźbierski, K., Magdziarz, M., Metzler, R. Stochastic memory resetting.

In preparation P8: Asymmetric branching trees and their genealogy Frederik Mølkjær Andersen (University of Copenhagen) stand: S8 Branching processes track population sizes over time and can be constructed by counting branches in subsets of an underlying family tree. Two tree structures have received particular attention: splitting trees, where reproduction occurs throughout an individual’s life, and branching trees, where reproduction happens only at death. Both satisfy the branching property, but in branching trees, it takes a particularly simple form that enables distributional characterizations via renewal-like integral equations. We introduce a new class of family trees, called asymmetric branching trees, in which individuals may reproduce during life, but at each reproduction event, the mother is killed and then immediately resurrected as an additional offspring, inheriting key characteristics such as her age. In this way, offspring are still attached only at the ends of branches, preserving the structural simplicity of branching trees while capturing a broad range of biologically relevant models, including inhomogeneous age-dependent birth and death processes typically modeled with splitting trees. Building on this foundation, we analyze the genealogical structure of asymmetric branching trees. The genealogy of an asymmetric branching tree, defined as the ancestral tree of extant individuals at a fixed observation time, admits a natural recursive description. With respect to an enlarged filtration, this genealogy satisfies a conditional branching property of its own, and by analyzing the reduced branching process, which counts only lineages with surviving descendants, we obtain explicit distributional results that fully characterize the genealogical structure. P9: Ruin Probability Approximation for Bidimensional Brownian Risk Model with Tax.

P10: Asymptotic Behaviour of Vertex-Shift Dynamics on Unimodular Networks Bharath Roy Choudhury (Dioscuri Centre for Random Walks in Geometry and Topology, Jagiellonian University) stand: S10 Vertex-shifts provide a framework for navigating on graphs by specifying, for each vertex, a unique “next” vertex. Such a shift induces dynamics on the space \\(\\mathcal{G}_*\\) of rooted networks: starting from a probability measure \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) on \\(\\mathcal{G}_*\\), one obtains the set \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{P}}\\) of push-forward measures under the successive iterations of the vertex-shift. The accumulation points of \\(\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathcal{P}}\\), termed as \\(f\\)-probabilities, describe the long-term behaviour of these iterations. This paper establishes general sufficient conditions on \\(f\\)—namely periodicity and finiteness of its orbits—for the existence of \\(f\\)-probabilities. Furthermore, when \\(f\\)-probabilities exist, we give sufficient conditions under which they are either absolutely continuous or singular with respect to the initial measure \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). In the special case where \\(f\\) is \\(1\\)-periodic and \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) is unimodular, we derive the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the \\(f\\)-probability with respect to \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). Applications include the Parent vertex-shift on certain classes of unimodular Family Trees—where each vertex is mapped to its parent—yielding an explicit, unique \\(f\\)-probability. A second application considers the record vertex-shift on skip-free-to-the-left (also known as left-continuous) random walks with non-negative mean increments. In this setting, we derive the record probability, namely the \\(f\\)-probability associated to the record vertex-shift that maps each point on the trajectory of the random walk to its next record. The record probability describes the trajectory “seen from” the maximum value of the walk. These results unify dynamical and measure-theoretic perspectives on network navigation, extending tools from stochastic geometry and unimodular random graphs. Some of the main results are as follows. Theorem. Let \\([\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{o}]\\) be a random network, \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) be its distribution and \\(f\\) be an a.s. \\(1\\)-periodic vertex-shift on \\([\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{o}]\\). Then, the \\(f\\)-probability \\(\\mathcal{P}^f\\) of \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) exists. Moreover, if \\([\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{o}]\\) is unimodular, then \\(\\mathcal{P}^f\\) is absolutely continuous with respect to \\(\\mathcal{P}\\). The limit function \\(d^f_{\\infty}(o)= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}d^f_n(o)\\) exists and is almost surely finite under \\(\\mathcal{P}^f\\). The Radon-Nikodym derivative of \\(\\mathcal{P}^f\\) with respect to \\(\\mathcal{P}^f\\) is given by \\[\\frac{d \\mathcal{P}^f}{d \\mathcal{P}}[G,o] = d_{\\infty}(o) \\mathbf{1}\\{\\text{o is a trap}\\}.\\] Theorem. Let \\([\\mathbb{Z},0,X]\\) be the marked rooted network whose vertices are \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), root is \\(0\\), and marks \\(X=(X_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\) on edges \\((n,n+1)_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\) represent the increments of a skip-free-to-the-left random walk with \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_0] \\geq 0\\).

The corresponding Schrödinger semigroup \\(\\big\\{e^{-tH}: t \\geq 0\\big\\}\\) consists of integral operators, i.e. \\[e^{-tH} f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} u_t(x,y) f(y) dy, \\quad f \\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^d,dx), \\ t&gt;0.\\] In first part of the talk i will present new estimates for heat kernel of \\(u_t(x,y)\\). Our results show the contribution of the potential is described separately for each spatial variable, and the interplay between the spatial variables is seen only through the Gaussian kernel. This estimates will be presented on two common classes of potentials. For confining potentials we get two sided estimates and for decaying potentials we get new upper estimate. Methods we used to estimated kernel of semigroup allow to easily obtain sharp estimates of ground state for slowly varying potentials. Bibliography \\([1]\\) M. Baraniewicz, K.

P13: Path-dependent option pricing with two-dimensional PDE using MPDATA Paweł Magnuszewski (AGH University of Krakow) stand: S13 In this poster, we discuss a simple yet robust PDE method for evaluating path-dependent Asian-style options using the non-oscillatory forward-in-time second-order MPDATA finite-difference scheme. The valuation methodology involves casting the Black-Merton-Scholes equation as a transport problem by first transforming it into a homogeneous advection-diffusion PDE via variable substitution, and then expressing the diffusion term as an advective flux using the pseudo-velocity technique. As a result, all terms of the Black-Merton-Sholes equation are consistently represented using a single high-order numerical scheme for the advection operator. We detail the additional steps required to solve the two-dimensional valuation problem compared to MPDATA valuations of vanilla instruments documented in a prior study. Using test cases employing fixed-strike instruments, we validate the solutions against Monte Carlo valuations, as well as against an approximate analytical solution in which geometric instead of arithmetic averaging is used. The analysis highlights the critical importance of the MPDATA corrective steps that improve the solution over the underlying first-order \"upwind\" step. The introduced valuation scheme is robust: conservative, non-oscillatory, and positive-definite; yet lucid: explicit in time, engendering intuitive stability-condition interpretation and inflow/outflow boundary-condition heuristics. MPDATA is particularly well suited for two-dimensional problems as it is not a dimensionally split scheme. The documented valuation workflow also constitutes a useful two-dimensional case for testing advection schemes featuring both Monte Carlo solutions and analytic bounds. An implementation of the introduced valuation workflow, based on the PyMPDATA package and the Numba Just-In-Time compiler for Python, is provided as free and open source software.

Local geometry of a confined random walk through tilted interlacements Nicolas Bouchot (Université Paris Dauphine-PSL) The study of the local geometry of the simple random walk (SRW) on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d, d \\geq 3\\), in high-density regime was somewhat initiated through the works of Benjamini &amp; Sznitman \\([1]\\) on the SRW on the discrete torus. Sznitman \\([3]\\) then introduced random interlacements as an “infinite volume limit” of this SRW in the form of a Poisson cloud of SRW trajectories in \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d\\). In this talk, I will present a work about another way to achieve such high-density regime: trapping the random walk inside a large domain of \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d\\). This confined RW can be expressed as a RW on conductances given by the principal (discrete) Laplace eigenfunction. I will show how one can do a local coupling between this confined walk and random interlacements that are locally tilted by this eigenfunction, as well as an application for computing the covering time of an inner subset of the domain.

Random Walk among Moving Traps Alexander Drewitz (Universität zu Köln) Random walk and Brownian motion among static obstacles have been the subject of extensive research during the last couple of decades. Of particular interest have been the survival probability as well as the path behavior of the motion conditioned on survival. However, comparatively less attention has been given to scenarios involving moving traps. We survey some of the results obtained in the setting of a Poisson cloud of moving traps during the last decade and discuss a recently established functional central limit theorem in dimensions 6 and higher.

Any pair of distinct vertices is independently forming an edge with a probability decaying as a function of the product of the weights divided by the distance of the vertices. For this continuum percolation model we study the probability of existence of paths crossing annuli with increasing inner and outer radii in the quantitatively subcritical phase. We refer to such probabilities as annulus crossing probabilities. Depending on the inner and outer radius of the annulus, the power-law exponent of the degree distribution and the decay of the probability of long edges, we identify regimes where the crossing probabilities by a path are equivalent to the crossing probabilities by one or by two edges. As a corollary we get the subcritical one-arm exponents characterising the decay of the probability that a typical point is in a component with a large diameter.

In this setting, Voronoi cells are constructed from a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity \\(\\lambda\\), and each cell is independently colored white with probability \\(p\\) and black with probability \\(1-p\\). We focus on the percolation properties of the resulting random coloring as the intensity \\(\\lambda\\) goes to infinity. Our main result shows that, under mild geometric assumptions on the manifold \\(M\\), both the critical percolation threshold \\(p_c(M,\\lambda)\\) for the emergence of an unbounded white cluster and the uniqueness threshold \\(p_u(M,\\lambda)\\) converge to the Euclidean critical threshold \\(p_c(\\mathbb{R}^d)\\) in the high-intensity limit \\(\\lambda \\to \\infty\\). Truncating the marked random connection model Johannes Bäumler (University of California, Los Angeles) In the marked random connection model, for each pair of points \\(\\{ x, y \\}\\), there is an open edge between these points with probability depending on the Euclidean distance between the points and the marks of the points. When are the long edges necessary for the existence of an infinite cluster? The truncation problem asks whether one can remove all long enough edges while still retaining an infinite open cluster. We discuss this question in the strong decay regime.

In 1939, Keller conjectured \\([1]\\) that every polynomial map \\(F\\) whose Jacobian determinant is a nonzero constant has a compositional inverse \\(F^{-1}\\) that is itself a polynomial map. This hypothesis, known as the Jacobian conjecture, is still one of the greatest unsolved problems of mathematics, and appears in Smale’s list \\([2]\\) of 18 open mathematical problems for the 21st century. The combinatorial approach to the Jacobian conjecture, developed more recently from the original context of algebraic geometry, is based on rephrasing the underlying concepts in terms of families of trees. We provide some new insights in this line of research, by using probabilistic methods, such as random trees, Markov chains, and branching processes. This approach also allows us to show that the high degree coefficients of \\(F^{-1}\\) are ‘small’, thereby proving an approximate version of the Jacobian conjecture.

De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory and quasilinear SPDEs with transport noise Antonio Agresti (Sapienza University of Rome) The De Giorgi–Nash–Moser (DGNM) estimates are one of the cornerstones of the regularity theory of PDEs, ensuring Hölder continuity for solutions to linear parabolic equations with bounded and measurable coefficients. In deterministic settings, they are particularly effective in establishing the existence of global smooth solutions of quasilinear parabolic PDEs in divergence form. However, their extension to SPDEs with transport noise remains a significant challenge. In this talk, I will present recent results establishing DGNM-type estimates for SPDEs driven by smooth transport noise. We show that even weak formulations suffice to obtain global smooth solutions for a broad class of quasilinear SPDEs, including Lotka–Volterra-type systems arising in population dynamics. I will also discuss the main challenges in extending these results to rough noise, which is essential for treating SPDEs with nonlinear transport noise.

In this work, we propose and study the stochastic Euler dynamics – a continuous-time Markov process that is equivalent to a linear spline interpolation of a random timestep (forward) Euler method. We understand the stochastic Euler dynamics as a path-valued ansatz for the ODE solution that shall be approximated. We first obtain qualitative insights by studying deterministic Euler dynamics which we derive through a first order approximation to the infinitesimal generator of the stochastic Euler dynamics. In the context of linear ODEs, these determinstic Euler dynamics describe the dynamics of the expectation of the stochastic Euler dynamics. Then we show convergence of the stochastic Euler dynamics to the ODE solution by studying the associated infinitesimal generators and by a novel local truncation error analysis. Next we prove stability by an immediate analysis of the random timestep Euler method and by deriving Foster–Lyapunov criteria for the stochastic Euler dynamics; the latter also yield bounds on the speed of convergence to stationarity. The paper ends with a discussion of second-order stochastic Euler dynamics and a series of numerical experiments that appear to verify our analytical results.

Poisson Hail on a Wireless Ground Sergey Foss (Heriot-Watt University) In the talk, we will present a new model which incorporates three key ingredients of a large class of wireless communication systems: (1) spatial interactions through interference – see e.g. \\([1]\\), (2) dynamics of the queueing type, with users joining and leaving – see e.g. \\([2]\\), and (3) carrier sensing and collision avoidance as used in, e.g., WiFi – see e.g. \\([3]\\). In systems using (3), rather than directly accessing the shared resources upon arrival, a customer is considerate and waits to access them until nearby users in service have left. This new model can be seen as a missing piece of a larger puzzle that contains such dynamics as spatial birth-and-death processes, the Poisson-Hail model, and wireless dynamics as key other pieces. It is shown that, under natural assumptions, this model can be represented as a Markov process on the space of counting measures. The main results are then two-fold. The first is on the shape of the stability region and, more precisely, on the characterization of the critical value of the arrival rate that separates stability from instability. The second is of a more qualitative or perhaps even ethical nature. There is evidence that for natural values of the system parameters, the implementation of sensing and collision avoidance stabilizes a system that would be unstable if immediate access to the shared resources would be granted. In other words, for these parameters, renouncing greedy access makes sharing sustainable, whereas indulging in greedy access kills the system.

A branching annihilating random walk model Alice Callegaro (Technical University of Munich) We study a branching-annihilating random walk in which particles evolve on the lattice in discrete generations. Each particle produces a Poissonian number of offspring which independently move to a uniformly chosen site within a fixed distance from their parent’s position. Whenever a site is occupied by at least two particles, all the particles at that site are annihilated. This can be thought of as a very strong form of local competition and implies that the system is not monotone. For certain ranges of the parameters of the model, the system dies out almost surely or survives with positive probability. In an even more restricted parameter range, survival can be strengthened to complete convergence with a non-trivial invariant measure and in dimension one, to a shape theorem. A central tool in the proof is comparison with oriented percolation on a coarse-grained level, using carefully tuned density profiles which expand in time and are reminiscent of discrete travelling wave solutions.

Explosion of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes with critical immediate offspring Matthias Meiners (University of Gießen) In my talk, I will consider the phenomenon of explosion in general (Crump-Mode-Jagers) branching processes, which refers to the event where an infinite number of individuals are born in finite time. In a critical setting where the expected number of immediate offspring per individual is exactly 1, whether or not explosion occurs depends on the fine properties of the reproduction point process.

With the recent development of GWAS methods, it has become essential to link the evolution of the trait distribution to the underlying evolution of allelic frequencies at many loci, co-contributing to the trait value. The way most articles go about this is to make assumptions on the trait distribution, and use Wright’s formula to model how the evolution of the trait translates on each individual locus. Here, we take a gene’s eye-view of the system, starting from an explicit finite-loci model with selection, drift, recombination and mutation, in which the trait value is a direct product of the genome. We let the number of loci go to infinity under the assumption of strong recombination, and characterize the limit behavior of a given locus with a McKean-Vlasov SDE and the corresponding Fokker-Planck IPDE. In words, the selection on a typical locus depends on the mean behaviour of the other loci which can be approximated with the law of the focal locus. Results include the independence of two loci and explicit stationary distribution for allelic frequencies at a given locus (under some hypotheses on the fitness function). We recover Wright’s formula and the breeder’s equation as special cases. This is joint work with P. Courau and A. Lambert. Convergence of a general structured individual-based model with possibly unbounded growth, birth and death rates Virgile BRODU (Université de Lorraine, Inria Nancy Grand-Est) First, we introduce càdlàg measure-valued processes, with biological motivations. We focus on a construction with Poisson point measures, with useful martingale properties. Then, we present a general convergence result for these measure-valued processes. In the literature, such a convergence result is proven with bounded growth, birth and death rates (\\([1]\\),\\([2]\\),\\([3]\\),\\([4]\\),\\([5]\\)). We present a more general framework with unbounded rates, where the convergence still holds true in a weighted space of measures. This is joint work with Nicolas Champagnat and Coralie Fritsch.

Origin and persistence of polymorphism in loci targeted by disassortative preference: a general model Manon Costa (Université de Toulouse) The emergence and persistence of polymorphism within populations generally requires specific regimes of natural or sexual selection. Here, we develop a unified theoretical frame- work to explore how polymorphism at targeted loci can be generated and maintained by either disassortative mating choice or balancing selection due to, for example, heterozygote advantage. In this talk I will develop the result obtained in \\([1]\\). Our theoretical study of the model confirms that the conditions for the persistence of a given level of allelic polymorphism depend on the relative reproductive advantages among pairs of individuals. Interestingly, equilibria with unbalanced allelic frequencies were shown to emerge from successive introduction of mutants. We then investigate the role of the function linking allelic divergence to reproductive advantage on the evolutionary fate of alleles within the population. Our results highlight the significance of the shape of this function for both the number of alleles maintained and their level of genetic divergence. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Coron, C., Costa, M.

In this study, we solve exit problems and potential measure for a omega-killed reflected level-dependent Lévy process which is exponentially killed with a killing intensity \\(\\omega(\\cdot)\\), that depends on the present state of the process. All identities are given in terms of new generalizations of scale functions, which are solution to Volterra equations. We also discuss the existence of solution of the SDE given in \\((1)\\). Lévy processes under level-dependent Poissonian switching Noah Daniel Beelders (University of Liverpool) The applicability of spectrally negative Lévy processes (i.e. Lévy processes with only downward jumps) in ruin theory dates back to the classical Cramér-Lundberg model which utilised a compound Poisson process with positive drift as a model of the underlying surplus process. Since then, research in this field has grown rapidly and the literature on such models has continually expanded (see \\([1]\\) for an extensive monograph on ruin theory and related concepts). \\(\\;\\;\\) Further extensions of these models have received a lot of attention in recent years. For instance, the refracted Lévy process, first introduced in \\([5]\\), extends the classical Lévy risk model by allowing for a reduction in its drift immediately once it moves above some threshold \\(b\\). This may hence be used to model the dividend payments of an insurer once their surplus is greater than some threshold \\(b\\) (see also \\([4, 7, 9]\\) for further contributions relating to refracted Lévy processes). The work of \\([8]\\) further generalised the refracted Lévy process by allowing it to immediately change dynamics between two independent spectrally negative Lévy processes (SNLPs) \\(X := \\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}\\) and \\(Y:= \\{Y_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}\\) when it moves below or above a threshold \\(b\\), respectively, provided that there is no Gaussian component in the unbounded variation case. \\(\\;\\;\\) For this presentation (based on \\([2]\\)), a further extension of the aforementioned models is considered in which the switch between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) does not occur immediately when \\(b\\) is crossed, but instead when it is above (below) \\(b\\) and coincides with an arrival epoch of an independent Poisson process. Under this extension, the corresponding process \\(U := \\{U_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}\\) is a solution to the SDE with level-dependent switching \\[\\tag{1} U_t = U_0 + \\int^t_0 \\mathbf{1}_{\\{U_{T_{N(s)}} \\leq b\\}} \\mathrm{d} X_s +\\int^t_0 \\mathbf{1}_{\\{U_{T_{N(s)}} &gt; b\\}} \\mathrm{d} Y_s ,\\] where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are defined as above, and are independent of the Poisson process \\(N\\) with arrival times \\(T_0 = 0\\) and \\(\\{T_i\\}_{i\\geq 1}\\). \\(\\;\\;\\) Utilising the Poisson arrival epochs, we show that a pathwise solution exists to Eq. \\((1)\\) even in the unbounded variation case with a Gaussian component. It will then be shown that a set of identities for the two sided exit problems and the potential measures (killed and non-killed) of \\(U\\) can be established in terms of generalisations of the classical scale functions from Chapter 8 of \\([6]\\) (see also Chapter VII.2 in \\([3]\\)). Then, to illustrate the applicability of these results, the probability of ruin is derived for a risk process with delays in the dividend payments.

Optimality of a barrier strategy in a spectrally negative Lévy model with a level-dependent intensity of bankruptcy Jean-Francois Renaud (UQAM) The stochastic control problem concerned with the maximization of dividend payments in a model based on a spectrally negative Lévy process (SNLP) has attracted a lot of research interest since the papers of Avram, Palmowski &amp; Pistorius (2007) and Loeffen (2008). In that problem, a dividend strategy is said to be optimal if it maximises the expected present value of dividend payments made up to the time of ruin, which is a standard first-passage time below zero. In this talk, I will consider a version of this stochastic control problem in which the (controlled) process is allowed to spend time under zero, but is then subject to a level-dependent intensity of bankruptcy. In a joint paper with Dante Mata (UQAM &amp; CRM), we were able to prove that there exists a barrier strategy that is optimal for this control problem, under a mild assumption on the Lévy measure.

In nonhomogeneous environments, such as aqueous two-phase systems or biological condensates with different diffusion coefficients in different phases, the solution to a Langevin equation is not unique unless the interpretation of stochastic integrals involved is selected. We analyse the diffusion of particles in such systems and evaluate the mean, the mean square displacement, and the distribution of particles, as well as the variance of the time-averaged mean-squared displacements \\([1]\\). We provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter \\(\\alpha\\), with particular attention to the Itô, Stratonovich, and Hänggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours. Furthermore, heterogeneous diffusion is also considered when the particle is subjected to an external force.

TBA Michał Balcerek (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) A souvenirs collector’s walk: The distribution of the number of steps of a continuous time random walk ending at a given position Igor M. Sokolov (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin) We consider a random walker performing a continuous time random walk (CTRW) with a symmetric step lengths’ distribution possessing a finite second moment and with a power-law waiting time distribution with finite or diverging first moment. The problem we pose concerns the distribution of the number of steps of the corresponding CTRW conditioned on the final position of the walker at some long time t. For positions within the scaling domain of the probability density function (PDF) of final displacements, the distributions of the number of steps show a considerable amount of universality, and are different in the cases when the corresponding CTRW corresponds to subdiffusion and to normal diffusion. We moreover note that the mean value of the number of steps can be obtained independently, and follows from the solution of the Poisson equation with the right-hand side depending on the PDF of displacements only. This approach works not only in the scaling domain, but also in the large deviation domain of the corresponding PDF, where the behavior of the mean number of steps is very sensitive to the details of the waiting time distribution beyond its power-law asymptotics.

The single stopping case was previously solved by Porosinski (1987), who addressed the problem of maximizing the probability of selecting the overall maximum from a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from the uniform distribution. He derived the optimal stopping rule under certain assumptions on the distribution of the random horizon.In this talk, we extend the setting to allow multiple stopping opportunities. We explore the conditions on the distribution required for optimality and present an optimal multiple stopping strategy under a stronger assumption on the distribution.

Our main point will be that the optimality of the Odds-strategy is also characterized by a discrete version the Dynkin formula which we introduce in this paper.

Stochastic filtering equations for diffusions on infinite graphs Tomoyuki Ichiba (University of California Santa Barbara) We shall discuss diffusions with mean-field interactions and interactions through a tree structure by introducing stochastic differential equations with distributional constraints. This class of system includes a system of directed chain stochastic differential equations, and it has an infinite-dimensional feature and so does the corresponding system of filtering equations we discuss. We also discuss approximations of the system by particle systems to determine the distributions and its application for portfolio optimization.  Convergence Analysis of Real-time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) for a class of Recurrent Neural Networks Konstantinos Spiliopoulos (Boston University) Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly trained with the truncated backpropagation-through-time (TBPTT) algorithm. For the purposes of computational tractability, the TBPTT algorithm truncates the chain rule and calculates the gradient on a finite block of the overall data sequence. Such approximation could lead to significant inaccuracies, as the block length for the truncated backpropagation is typically limited to be much smaller than the overall sequence length. In contrast, Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is an online optimization algorithm which asymptotically follows the true gradient of the loss on the data sequence as the number of sequence time steps t→∞. RTRL forward propagates the derivatives of the RNN hidden/memory units with respect to the parameters and, using the forward derivatives, performs online updates of the parameters at each time step in the data sequence. RTRL’s online forward propagation allows for exact optimization over extremely long data sequences, although it can be computationally costly for models with large numbers of parameters. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm for a class of RNNs. The convergence analysis establishes a fixed point for the joint distribution of the data sequence, RNN hidden layer, and the RNN hidden layer forward derivatives as the number of data samples from the sequence and the number of training steps tend to infinity. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm to a stationary point of the loss. Numerical studies illustrate our theoretical results. One potential application area for RTRL is the analysis of financial data, which typically involve long time series and models with small to medium numbers of parameters. This makes RTRL computationally tractable and a potentially appealing optimization method for training models. Thus, we include an example of RTRL applied to limit order book data.

Geiss and Ylinen in \\([1]\\), we investigate regularity properties of fully path-dependent stochastic differential equations. The used coupling method is robust and allows for results under minimal structural assumptions. Two cases of the coupling method are of special interest: The isotropic coupling to treat the Malliavin Sobolev space \\(\\mathbb{D}_{1,2}\\) and the related Besov spaces obtained by real interpolation, and secondly, a cut-off coupling to treat the \\(L_p\\)-variation of backward stochastic differential equations where the forward process is the investigated stochastic differential equation. The aim of the talk is two-fold: We re-call the coupling idea for the Gaussian structure on the Wiener space, and then we apply this method to fully path-dependent stochastic differential equations.

Ernst (Imperial College London) This talk considers the so called Brownian spider, also known as Walsh Brownian motion, as first introduced in the epilogue of Walsh (1978). In an attempt to understand the unboundedness of the variation of the Wiener process, Lester Dubins asked the following question: for a Brownian spider with n rays how does one design a stopping time to maximize the \"coverage\" of Brownian motion on the spider for a given expected time? In this formulation, the coverage of the spider is measured as the sum of the lengths of its arms. This talk discusses some advances on the Dubins spider problem that have been made by Ernst (2016) and Ernst (2025). We shall also touch on a solution to a more \"friendly\" variant of the Dubins spider problem given by Bednarz, Ernst, and Osekowski (2024).

Indistinguishability of unbounded occupied and vacant components in Boolean models Artem Sapozhnikov (Leipzig University) We consider general Boolean models on Riemannian symmetric spaces driven by insertion or deletion tolerant point processes. For insertion (resp. deletion) tolerant Boolean models, we show that unbounded occupied (resp. vacant) connected components are indistinguishable by isometries invariant component properties. In particular, this implies the uniqueness monotonicity for both occupied and vacant sets of Poisson-Boolean models. This is a joint work with Yingxin Mu (Leipzig).

Pairs of balls are chosen one by one, in either a deterministic or random way. When a pair is chosen, it “collides” in the sense that the pseudo-velocities change according to the usual laws of totally elastic collisions. In other words, the total energy and total momentum are conserved. A one-dimensional pinned billiard balls model with local energy redistribution was considered in \\([1]\\). The results suggest that the model has a hydrodynamic limit and the parameters for the limit, the local variance \\(\\sigma\\) and mean \\(\\mu\\), satisfy the coupled partial differential equations with freezing \\[\\begin{aligned} \\sigma_t(x,t) &amp; = - \\mu_x(x,t) {\\bf 1}_{ \\sigma(x,t) &gt;0},\\\\ \\mu_t(x,t) &amp;= - \\sigma_x(x,t) {\\bf 1}_{ \\sigma(x,t) &gt;0},\\\\ \\sigma(x,t) &amp; \\geq 0.\\end{aligned}\\] If the initial conditions are continuous then there exist continuous solutions for all time.

We then present a simple stochastic model of neural network whose synapses exhibit short-term facilitation. The metastable properties of this system are studied quantitatively, through the analysis of its quasi-stationary distribution.

Nonparametric estimation of the jump rate in mean field interacting systems of neurons Eva Löcherbach (Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne) We consider finite systems of \\(N\\) interacting neurons described by non-linear Hawkes processes in a mean field frame. Neurons are described by their membrane potential. They spike randomly, at a rate depending on their potential. In between successive spikes, their membrane potential follows a deterministic flow. We estimate the spiking rate function based on the observation of the system of \\(N\\) neurons over a fixed time interval \\([0,t]\\). Asymptotic are taken as \\(N,\\) the number of neurons, tends to infinity. We introduce a kernel estimator of Nadaraya-Watson type and discuss its asymptotic properties with help of the deterministic dynamical system describing the mean field limit.

Asymptotic Exit Problems for a Singular Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equation Tom Klose (University of Oxford) We consider a singular stochastic reaction-diffusion equation with a cubic non-linearity on the \\(3\\)D torus and study its behaviour as it exits a domain of attraction of an asymptotically stable point. Mirroring the results of Freidlin and Wentzell in the finite-dimensional case, we relate the logarithmic asymptotics of its mean exit time and exit place to the minima of the corresponding (quasi-)potential on the boundary of the domain. The challenge, in our setting, is that the stochastic equation is singular such that its solution only lives in a Hölder–Besov space of distributions. The proof accordingly combines a classical strategy with novel controllability statements as well as continuity and locally uniform large deviation results obtained via the theory of regularity structures. Integration by parts formula and quantum field theory Francesco Carlo De Vecchi (Università di Pavia) Characterizing a probability measure through an integration by parts formula is a classical problem in stochastic analysis. It finds applications in (Euclidean) quantum field theory, being related to the solutions of the equations of motion for the correlation functions of the quantum field. We approach this problem in the particular case of quantum field theory with exponential interaction on \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), studying a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation associated to a stochastic quantization equation for such a model. We prove that, under some conditions on the support of the measure, the solution to this Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation exists and is unique, providing a complete characterization of the exponential measure by an integration by parts formula.

In this work, we explore analogous phenomena for Brownian motion under Poissonian resetting, a process that introduces interruptions at random times, fundamentally altering its dynamics. We derive closed-form expressions for the probability density functions corresponding to the first and second arcsine laws, highlighting their distinct behavior under resetting. Additionally, we present numerical insights into the third arcsine law, providing a comprehensive perspective on this generalization of classical results.

Dynamics, bifurcations and randomness in integrate and fire neuron models Piotr Kowalczyk (Wrocław University of Science and Technlogy) We present the investigations of a class of minimal neuron models which are termed “integrate and fire models”\\([1,2]\\). These models capture so-called spiking and bursting behaviour of neurons \\([2]\\). We focus on phase space transitions which lead to spike increment, that is an increased number of voltage spikes exhibited by neurons which occur in our model systems. In particular, we focus on a specific type of phase space transition (bifurcation) which is triggered by the presence of a limit cycle, which we term a canard cycle, and resets. We explain the mechanism behind this transition \\([4]\\), and apply our analytical results to a class of conductance based adaptive integrate and fire models \\([3,5]\\), which through increased complexity capture some biological aspects of neuronal conduction. Lastly, we present the results of a numerical experiment aimed at investigating the effects of noise on phase space transitions explained analytically. Consider the following family of adaptive integrate and fire models \\[\\tag{1} v&#39; = |v|-w+I\\\\ w&#39; = \\varepsilon F(v,w), %\\label{eq:modelgen}\\] where \\(I\\) is a regular parameter representing an applied constant current, \\(0&lt;\\varepsilon\\ll 1\\) is a small parameter, with the limit \\(\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0\\) relevant to the full system, and \\(F\\) is a smooth function, which we will take to be linear in both arguments for simplicity, and without loss of generality on the dynamics of interest. We append to system \\((1)\\) the following reset rule: for \\(v=v_{\\mathrm{thr}}\\), we have \\[\\tag{2}%\\label{eq:reset} (v, \\;w) \\longrightarrow \\left(v_{\\mathrm{res}},\\; w+k\\right),\\] meaning that as soon as \\(v\\) reaches some threshold value \\(v_{\\mathrm{thr}}\\), the values of state variables \\(v\\) and \\(w\\) are reset to \\(v_{\\mathrm{res}}\\) and \\(w+k\\), respectively. System \\((1)\\) is parametrised by the fast time \\(\\tau\\) and it is useful to rescale time so as to introduce the slow time \\(t=\\varepsilon\\tau\\), which brings system \\((1)\\) in its alternative slow-time formulation, namely \\[\\tag{3} \\varepsilon\\dot{v} = |v|-w+I\\\\ \\dot{w} = F(v,w). %\\label{eq:modelgenbis}\\] The reset rule \\((2)\\) remains unchanged in the alternative slow-time formulation \\((3)\\). The main results are summarised by the following two propositions and a theorem: Proposition 1. Consider system \\((1)\\)-\\((2)\\) with positive parameters \\(v_{\\mathrm{thr}} = {\\mathcal{O}}(1)\\), \\(I = \\mathcal{O}(v_{\\mathrm{res}})\\). Then for every \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) small enough and \\(w_0 &gt; (1+\\varepsilon)(v_{\\mathrm{res}} + I)\\), there exist some \\(k &gt; 0\\) and \\(N \\geq 1\\) such that the system possesses a limit cycle characterised by \\(N\\geq 1\\) resets, and a periodic point \\((v_{\\mathrm{res}}, w_0)\\). Theorem 1. A major result. Consider system \\((1)\\)-\\((2)\\) with positive parameters \\(v_{\\mathrm{thr}} = {\\mathcal{O}}(1) \\gg v_{\\mathrm{res}}\\), \\(I = {\\mathcal{O}}(v_{\\mathrm{res}})\\). Then for every \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) small enough and \\(w_0 = (1+\\varepsilon)(v_{\\mathrm{res}} + I)\\), there exist \\(k &gt; 0\\) and \\(N\\geq 1\\) such that the system possesses an \\(N\\)-reset periodic cycle and a periodic point \\((v_{\\mathrm{res}}, w_0)\\) with the following set of inequalities: \\[\\tag{4} w_0 = (1+\\varepsilon)(v_{\\mathrm{res}} + I) = w_{N} &gt; w_{N-1} &gt; w_{N-2} &gt;\\ldots &gt; w_1, %\\label{eq:exstCN}\\] where \\(w_i\\), \\(1\\leq i\\leq N-1\\), are the values of the \\(w\\)-component of the system immediately after the \\(i\\)th reset. Such a periodic cycle is a canard cycle. Proposition 2. Consequences of Propositions 1 and Theorem 1. Consider system \\((1)\\)-\\((2)\\) with parameters \\(v_{\\mathrm{thr}} = {\\mathcal{O}}(1) \\gg v_{\\mathrm{res}}\\), \\(I = {\\mathcal{O}}(v_{\\mathrm{res}})\\), and some \\(k^*\\), all positive. Let us further assume that a canard cycle with \\(N\\) number of resets as described by Theorem 1 exists for a given set of parameter values. Then for some \\(k\\), sufficiently close to but different from \\(k^*\\), there exists a periodic cycle in the system characterised by \\(N + 1\\) of resets, and a periodic point \\((v_{\\mathrm{res}}, w_0)\\) such that the inequality \\[w_0 = (1+\\varepsilon)(v_{\\mathrm{res}} + I) = w_{N + 1} &gt; w_{N} &gt; w_{N-1} &gt; w_{N-2} &gt;\\ldots &gt; w_1 \\label{eq:exstCNp1}\\] holds. Moreover, we have that \\(|w_{N+1}-w_N| \\ll \\varepsilon\\). Such a periodic cycle is a canard cycle. The essential conclusion from the above propositions and the theorem is that the spike increment scenario is a discontinuous event in the parameter space, howevever the discontinuity is of the size smaller then some \\(\\varepsilon\\), and for spike adding to take place a so-called Canard cycle, that is a limit cycle with a segment of the trajectory along the repelling part of the slow manifold, has to be present in the system. We will show numerical evidence that this scenario is typical to a large class of integrate and fire models, see \\([5]\\). Finally, the effect of noise on the spike adding scenario discussed here will be investigated numerically. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Izhikevich, E. M. \"Simple model of spiking neurons\".

The role of the fractional material derivative in Lévy walks Marek Teuerle (Faculty of Pure and Applied Mathematics, Hugo Steinhaus Center, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology) The Lévy walk model, a key framework for describing anomalous diffusion processes with finite-second moments, is distinguished by its intrinsic coupling of jump lengths and waiting times \\([1]\\). This model has proven invaluable for capturing the dynamics of diverse systems, from the collective movement of biological organisms like bacteria and marine predators to physical phenomena involving cold atoms and blinking quantum dots (see \\([2,3]\\) for examples). Recent theoretical advances have clarified the macroscopic behavior of Lévy walks. It has been shown that their scaling limits, under Skorokhod’s \\(\\mathbb{J}_1\\) convergence, are \\(\\alpha\\)-stable processes governed by a strongly dependent inverse \\(\\alpha\\)-stable subordinator or by some combinations of these kind of processes \\([4]\\). It is also a well-established fact that the governing dynamics of the Lévy walks’ scaling limit can be described by the fractional material derivative, an extension of the classical material derivative to fractional calculus \\([4,5]\\). This presentation focuses on the numerical approximation of this fractional material derivative. We introduce a novel finite-volume upwind scheme that incorporates spatiotemporal coupling of the underlying process and builds upon known techniques for fractional derivatives \\([6,7]\\). We confirm the stability of our proposed method. Furthermore, we will demonstrate the scheme’s accuracy by applying it to a one-sided probability problem (jumps/displacements only to the left or only to the right) associated with Lévy walks and comparing the results with traditional Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we will outline an extension of our numerical approach to accommodate Lévy walks with arbitrary step directions, so-called biased Lévy walks. Bibliography \\([1]\\) J. Klafter, A.

The SRRW has been a subject of great interest in the last few decades, since it exhibits a phase transition from diffusive to superdiffusive behavior, based on \\(p\\) unlike the usual walk. Bertenghi and Laulin (2024) studied a variant of the SRRW in which the past step is selected with probability proportional to a weight sequence that is regularly varying of index \\(\\gamma&gt;-1\\). The innovation steps were assumed to be independent and identically distributed with finite variance. The law of large numbers and fluctuations around the large number limit have been obtained for certain values of \\(p\\in \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma+1},\\frac{\\gamma+1/2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\gamma\\geq 0\\). In this talk, we shall provide a complete picture of the limiting behavior of the random walk; the law of large numbers and functional limit theorems for all \\(p\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(\\gamma&gt;-1\\). We discuss the phase transition emerging in such a walk with novel superdiffusive scalings in the critical regime. Along with the usual \\(\\sqrt{n\\log n}\\) scale observed for the SRRW, a variety of different scalings (e.g. \\(\\sqrt{n(\\log n)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\), \\(\\sqrt{n(\\log n)^{-2}}\\), \\(\\sqrt{n\\log n\\log\\log n}\\) etc.) appear in the generalized walk. Further, depending on the scaling exponent, one can have both almost sure and weak functional limit theorems in the critical regime, in contrast to the usual SRRW where only weak limits are observed.

URL http://www.jstor.org/stable/1970008 Geostatistical modeling of positive definite matrices, with an application to diffusion tensor imaging Dipankar Bandyopadhyay (Virginia Commonwealth University) Geostatistical modeling for continuous point-referenced data has been extensively applied to neuroimaging, because it produces efficient and valid statistical inference. However, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a neuroimaging characterizing the brain’s anatomical structure, produces voxel-level positive definite (p.d) matrices. Current geostatistical modeling has not been extended to p.d matrices as introducing spatial dependence among positive definite matrices properly is non-trivial. In this paper, we use the spatial Wishart process, a spatial stochastic process (random field), where each p.d matrix-variate response marginally follows a Wishart distribution, and the spatial dependence is induced by latent Gaussian processes. This process is valid on an uncountable collection of spatial locations and is almost surely continuous, leading to a flexible way of modeling spatial dependence. Motivated by a DTI dataset of cocaine users, we propose a spatial matrix-variate regression model based on the spatial Wishart Process (sWP). However, a shortcoming of the sWP is the lack of a closed-form density function. Hence, we propose some approximations to obtain a feasible Cholesky decomposition model, and show that the Cholesky decomposition model is asymptotically equivalent to the sWP model. A local likelihood approximation technique is employed to achieve fast computation. Simulation studies and application to the motivating DTI data demonstrate that the Cholesky decomposition process model produces reliable inference, and improved performance, compared to existing alternatives.

Radosław Wieczorek (University of Silesia in Katowice) Stochastic particle models are very common in modern mathematical modelling, especially in biology and chemistry. In the talk we consider a situation when one of the population is abundant enough to use macroscopic approximation, while the other consist of a few particles and is described by a stochastic particle system. Such a scale separation leads to the so called hybrid models, where a stochastic particle system is coupled to partial differential equation. A hybrid stochastic individual-based model of proliferating cells with chemotaxis \\([2]\\) will be presented. The model is expressed by a branching diffusion process coupled to a partial differential equation describing concentration of chemotactic factor. It is shown that in the hydrodynamic limit when number of cells goes to infinity the model converges to the solution of a nonconservative Patlak-Keller-Segel-type system. A nonlinear mean-field stochastic particle model is defined and it is proven that the movement of descendants of a single cell in the individual model converges to this mean-field process when the number of particles goes to infinity.

Law of the iterated logarithm for Markov semigroups with exponential mixing property in the Wasserstein distance Dawid Czapla (Institute of Mathematics, University of Silesia in Katowice) The main goal of this talk is to present our recent result concerning the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for non-stationary, continuous-time Markov processes on Polish spaces. Specifically, our theorem applies to additive functionals of processes governed by stochastically continuous Markov-Feller semigroups that exhibit exponential mixing and non-expansiveness in the Wasserstein metric. To state the result more precisely, let us first introduce some notation. We work on a complete, separable metric space \\((X,\\rho)\\), endowed with its Borel \\(\\sigma\\)-field \\(\\mathcal{B}(X)\\). By \\(\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\) we denote the family of all Borel probability measures on \\(X\\), and, given any \\(r&gt;0\\), we write \\(\\mathcal{M}_{1,r}(X)\\) for the subset of \\(\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\) consisting of those measures \\(\\mu\\) for which \\(\\int_X \\rho(x_0,x)^r\\,\\mu(dx)&lt;\\infty\\) with some \\(x_0\\in X\\). Furthermore, let us recall that the Wasserstein distance on the set \\(\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}(X)\\) is given by \\[d_W(\\mu,\\nu)=\\sup\\left\\{\\left|\\int_X f\\,d(\\mu-\\nu) \\right|:\\; f:X\\to\\mathbb{R},\\;\\,\\operatorname{Lip}f \\leq 1\\right\\}\\quad\\text{for}\\quad \\mu,\\nu\\in\\mathcal{M}_{1,1}(X),\\] where \\(\\operatorname{Lip}f:=\\sup_{x\\neq y} |f(x)-f(y)|/\\rho(x,y)\\). The object of our study is a continuous-time Markov process \\(\\Phi:=\\{\\Phi_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\), evolving on the space \\((X,\\rho)\\), with associated transition semigroup \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\), consisting of Markov operators acting on \\(\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\). Concretely, this means that \\(\\Phi\\) is a family of \\(X\\)-valued random variables on a measurable space \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal{F})\\), equipped with a collection of probability measures \\(\\{\\mathbb{P}_x\\}_{x\\in X}\\), such that, for any \\(s,t\\geq 0\\), \\(x\\in X\\), and \\(A\\in\\mathcal{B}(X)\\), \\[\\mathbb{P}_x(\\Phi_0=x)=1,\\quad \\mathbb{P}_x(\\Phi_{s+t}\\in A\\,|\\,\\mathcal{F}_s)=\\mathbb{P}_{\\Phi_s}(\\Phi_t\\in A),\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\mathbb{P}_x(\\Phi_t\\in A)=P_t\\delta_x(A),\\] where \\(\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) is the natural filtration of \\(\\Phi\\), and \\(\\delta_x\\) denotes the Dirac measure at \\(x\\). Additionally, as usual, for every \\(\\mu\\in\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\), we define \\[\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu}(F):=\\int_X \\mathbb{P}_x(F)\\,\\mu(dx)\\quad\\text{for}\\quad F\\in\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty}:=\\sigma(\\Phi_t:\\;s\\geq 0).\\] Clearly, \\(\\Phi\\) can be then regarded as a Markov process on \\((\\Omega,\\mathcal{F}_{\\infty},\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu})\\) with initial distribution \\(\\mu\\). Our result relies on the following assumptions: \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) is stochastically continuous, i.e., for every \\(x\\in X\\) and each bounded continuous function \\(f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\), the map \\([0,\\infty) \\ni t\\mapsto \\int_X f\\,d(P_t\\delta_x)\\) is continuous at \\(t=0\\). \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) is Feller, i.e., the map \\(X \\ni x\\mapsto \\int_X f\\,d(P_t\\delta_x)\\) is continuous for every bounded continuous function \\(f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\). There exists \\(\\gamma\\in (0,\\infty)\\) such that \\[d_W(P_t\\delta_x,\\,P_t\\delta_y)\\leq e^{-\\gamma t}\\rho(x,y)\\quad\\text{for any}\\quad t\\geq 0,\\; x,y\\in X.\\] For some \\(\\mu_0\\in\\mathcal{M}_1(X)\\), there exist \\(x_0\\in X\\) and \\(\\zeta\\in (2,\\infty)\\) such that \\[\\sup_{t\\geq 0} \\int_X \\rho(x_0,x)^{\\zeta}\\,P_t\\mu_0(dx)&lt;\\infty.\\] Under conditions (A2)-(A4), it can be shown that \\(\\{P_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) admits a unique invariant probability measure \\(\\mu_*\\), which is a member of \\(\\mathcal{M}_{1,\\zeta}(X)\\). Let \\(g:X\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) be an arbitrary bounded Lipschitz continuous function such that \\(\\int_X g\\,d\\mu_*=0\\), and define \\[I_t(g):=\\int_0^t g(\\Psi_s)\\,ds\\quad\\text{for}\\quad t\\geq 0.\\] Moreover, put \\[\\chi_g(x)=\\int_0^{\\infty} P_t g(x)\\,dt\\quad\\text{for}\\quad x\\in X\\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\sigma_g^2:=\\mathbb{E}_{\\mu_*}\\left[\\left(\\chi_g(\\Phi_1)-\\chi_g(\\Phi_0)+I_1(g) \\right)^2\\right].\\] The announced result can be now formulated as follows. Theorem. Suppose that conditions (A1)-(A4) hold. Then \\(\\sigma_g^2\\) is finite, and whenever it is positive, the process \\(\\{I_t(g)\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\) satisfies the LIL under \\(\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu_0}\\), with \\(\\sigma_g^2\\) serving as its asymptotic variance, i.e., \\[\\liminf_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{I_t(g)}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma_g^2\\, t\\ln\\ln t}}=-1 \\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\limsup_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{I_t(g)}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma_g^2 \\,t\\ln\\ln t}}=1\\;\\;\\;\\mathbb{P}_{\\mu_0}-\\text{a.s.}\\] Moreover, \\(\\sigma_g^2\\) can also be expressed as \\(\\sigma_g^2=2\\int_X g\\chi_g\\,d\\mu_*=\\lim_{t\\to \\infty}\\mathbb{E}_{\\mu_0}\\left[I_t^2(g) \\right]/t.\\) In the talk, we will discuss the techniques employed in the proof of this theorem and, if time permits, outline some of its potential applications. Basically, the proof strategy involves a reduction to the discrete-time case and a martingale-type decomposition of \\(\\Phi\\), enabling the use of \\([3, \\text{Theorem}~1]\\) (a LIL criterion for martingales). The most challenging task, however, lies in transitioning from the stationary to the non-stationary setting, which we accomplish by leveraging certain ideas from \\([1]\\). The result applies, for instance, to solution process of stochastic differential equation with dissipative drift considered in \\([4]\\), as well as to diffusion processes on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) discussed in \\([\\text{§4.1}, 2]\\).

Hanna Wojewódka-Ściążko (University of Silesia in Katowice) This talk addresses the challenge of proving the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and the Law of the Iterated Logarithm (LIL) for a general class of continuous-time Markov processes evolving on Polish metric spaces, where the initial distribution is not assumed to be stationary. An important motivating example is the class of piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), whose deterministic parts follow continuous semiflows that are randomly switched at the jump times of a Poisson process (for a detailed description, see Section \\(7\\) of \\([1]\\)). Such models arise naturally in applications, including autoregulated gene expression (cf. \\([2]\\)). Although limit theorems for stochastic processes have been extensively studied, only a few versions are available for Markov processes on general Polish spaces, and even fewer address the non-stationary case. Regarding the CLT, perhaps the most general result to date is Theorem \\(2.1\\) in \\([3]\\). An analogous version of the LIL, albeit under slightly stronger assumptions, is given in Theorem \\(2.1\\) in \\([4]\\). Unfortunately, we have not been able to apply either of these results to the class of PDMPs with random flow switching discussed above. The main obstacle lies in our inability to verify exponential mixing in the Wasserstein distance, as required by both theorems. Instead, we are only able to establish exponential mixing in the bounded-Lipschitz (Fortet–Mourier) distance. To overcome this limitation, we have developed new versions of limit theorems that apply under weaker assumptions, specifically: a version of the CLT for nonstationary Markov-Feller processes (governed by semigroups \\(\\{P(t)\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\)) with a Polish state space \\(E\\), which are exponentially mixing in the bounded-Lipschitz distance, meaning that \\[\\begin{gathered} \\text{there exist a continuous function $V:E\\to[0,\\infty)$}\\\\ \\text{and constants $\\gamma, \\beta&gt;0$, $\\delta\\in(0,1)$ such that,}\\\\ \\text{for any Borel probability measures $\\mu$, $\\nu$ and every $t\\geq 0$}\\\\ d_{\\text{FM}}\\left(\\mu P(t),\\nu P(t)\\right)\\leq \\beta e^{-\\gamma t}\\left(\\int_E V\\;d(\\mu+\\nu)+1\\right)^{\\delta},\\end{gathered}\\] and satisfy a continuous Foster-Lyapunov condition, i.e. \\[\\begin{gathered} \\text{there exist $A,B\\geq 0$ and $\\Gamma&gt;0$ such that}\\\\ P(t)V^2(x)\\leq Ae^{-\\Gamma t}V^2(x)+B\\quad \\text{for all}\\quad x\\in E,\\;t\\geq 0\\end{gathered}\\] (cf. Theorem \\(3.1\\) in \\([1]\\)); a version of the LIL for a similar, though slightly narrower, class of processes. The main difference lies in replacing the exponential mixing condition with the assumption of the existence of an appropriate Markovian coupling. This type of assumption originates from \\([5]\\), and it naturally implies the exponential mixing property of the semigroup \\(\\{P(t)\\}_{t\\geq 0}\\). Both of these results will be discussed in detail during the talk. Bibliography \\([1]\\) D. Czapla, K. Horbacz, H.

In the most common setting, the trajectory of the polymer is given by a nearest-neighbour random walk path on the \\(d\\)-dimensional lattice, while the impurities (also called the environment) are given by a collection of i.i.d. centered random variables. In the recent years, there has been much focus on studying the scaling properties of the model around the critical point in spatial dimension \\(d=2\\). Remarkably, the work of F. Caravenna, R.

First, as shown in \\([1]\\), we recall that the empirical measure of the “shifted” environment \\(\\omega(X_k+\\cdot)\\) converges in law to some explicitly described random measure, thereby extending to the recurrent case the method of the “environment viewed from the particle”, originally introduced for transient ballistic RWRE. This allows, in particular, to describe the limit distribution of \\[\\tag{1} \\frac 1n \\sum_{k=1}^n f(\\omega(X_k), \\Delta X_k),\\] where \\(\\Delta X_k=X_{k+1}-X_k\\) and \\(f\\) is a bounded function. Next, assuming that the environment has a finite support, which is treated as a parameter, we establish in \\([2]\\) a Local Asymptotic Mixed Normality property for this parameter. We also show that the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the support parameter converges in law at the rate \\(\\sqrt n\\) to a mixture of normal distributions and is asymptotically efficient.

Its one-time marginals are a.s. singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure, meaning that the mass they assign to shrinking balls decays to zero faster than their Lebesgue volume. In this work we explore the intermittency properties of the Critical 2d SHF by studying the asymptotics of the h-th moment of the mass that it assigns to shrinking balls of radius ε and we determine that its ratio to the Lebesgue volume is of order ((1/ε))^p up to possible lower order corrections.

The model describes the price dynamics of a financial asset by allowing its volatility to be stochastic. This is implemented through a system of two stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with appropriate initial conditions. Although the formulation of the model is relatively simple, the problem of providing a rigorous mathematical description of the solution to the associated SDEs has turned out to be surprisingly difficult and remains unsolved to this day. In our talk, we present a new approach to characterizing the probability distribution in the SABR model. To achieve this, we perform an unconventional change of probability measure — unconventional in the sense of parameter dependence — which allows us to reduce the original problem of describing the solution to the initial SDEs to analyzing the probability distribution of a certain one-dimensional diffusion process that may explode. Using the approach developed by Karatzas and Ruf \\([2]\\) for explosive diffusions, we are able to compute the power transform of the price process in the SABR model. Remarkably, we are also able to deconstruct the parameter dependencies and invert the transform, obtaining the probability distribution of the SABR model as an explicitly given functional of a Brownian motion.

Characterization of moments in the SABR model Michał Barski (University of Warsaw) In this talk, I will present a new approach to computing moments in the SABR model by reducing the original system of stochastic differential equations to a one-dimensional diffusion process with possible explosion. The central idea is to introduce an auxiliary process θ, whose negative moments are directly related to the moments of the asset price in the SABR framework. Using the specific polynomial structure of the coefficients in the SDE for θ, we derive a recursive formula for the integer moments of the asset price. This recurrence takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations depending on the model parameters and can be solved explicitly in special parameter regimes, such as when \\(\\beta=0\\) or \\(\\rho=0\\). In the general case, the initial term of the recursion is characterized by its Laplace transform expressed as a power series. This method provides new analytical tools for studying the moment structure of the SABR model and, in many cases, leads to a unique identification of the distribution of the underlying asset price. The talk is based on a joint work with M. Wiśniewolski and B. Polaczyk. Measuring volatility: deterministic and stochastic perspectives (regularization by noise) Rafał Łochowski (Warsaw School of Economics and University of Warsaw) In the talk I will review several results on convergence of functions of sums of increments of stochastic processes or deterministic paths to limiting objects, which are known under the names like: volatility, integrated volatility, quadratic variation, \\(p\\)-variation, \\(\\psi\\)-variation etc. The emphasis will be on the sampling method used and the dependence of the existence and value of the limit on the sampling metod (partition scheme) chosen. For example, while for semimartingales the sampling method may be almost arbitrary, (though the mode of convergence may depend on the method chosen), for deterministic functions it is not the case.

The class of admissible potentials \\(V\\) consists of positive smooth measures, which includes, in particular, locally quasi-integrable positive functions, as well as generalized potentials, i.e. positive Borel measures that may be concentrated on \\(m\\)-negligible sets. Using the Green function of \\(L\\), we characterize the minimal set - depending only on \\(L\\) and \\(V\\) - where all possible zeros of non-trivial supersolutions to \\((1)\\) must lie. The key ingredient in establishing this structure result is the Feynman-Kac-type representation for supersolutions to \\((1)\\). As a corollary, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition on the potential \\(V\\), under the sole assumption that \\(V:\\mathbb R^d\\to [0,\\infty]\\) is Borel measurable, ensuring that the strong maximum principle holds for the operator \\(-L+V\\).

On dynamic approximation scheme for L'evy processes Victoria Knopova (Kyiv Taras Shevchenko National University) Due to infinite activity, simulating the trajectory a Lévy process can be technically challenging. In order to overcome the problem, one can use certain approximation tricks, e.g. the Asmussen-Rosiński procedure, which allows to approximate the trajectory of a Lévy process by that of a compoud Poisson process and a (scaled) Brownian motion by cutting out the small jumps on a fixed level. In my talk I will discuss the so-called “dynamic cutting procedure”, which extends this technique by means of time-dependent cutting. I will discuss the weak approximation rates for this scheme, the strong approximation rated for the Euler scheme for the Lévy driven SDE, and some numerical results. Bibliography \\([1]\\) D.

We adapt the main structure from the original idea of Watkins, who first introduced the Action Replay Process (ARP) as a proof device. We give precise bounds for the transitions of ARP and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) that we want to learn. Suppose we are give an MDP \\((\\overline {S},\\overline {A} ,\\overline{\\textsf{\\sf P}} ,R,\\gamma)\\) with \\(\\overline S\\) and \\(\\overline A\\) continuous compact spaces, and the transition kernel \\(\\overline{\\textsf{\\sf P}}\\) being nondegenerate and spread all over the space and the reward \\(R\\) bound and smooth as a function of state and action.

To explain the idea further, say that we interact with the (unknown) environment and obtain a sample \\((\\underline{\\mathrm{s}},\\underline{\\mathrm a})_n= \\{\\mathrm{s}_0,\\mathrm{a}_0,\\mathrm{s}_1, ..., \\mathrm{s}_n,\\mathrm{a}_n\\}\\) of size \\(n\\), we want to define \\({K} : {\\mathbb R}^{d_{S}} \\times {\\mathbb R}^{d_{A}} \\rightarrow {\\mathbb R}\\) a smooth non-negative compactly supported function such that based on our sample \\((\\underline{\\mathrm s},\\underline{\\mathrm a})_n\\) and for any function \\(f: \\overline{S}\\times \\overline{A} \\to \\mathbb R\\) at a point \\((s,a)\\) at depth \\(n\\) we can define the operation \\[%\\label{eq:kernel operator} \\mathcal{A}_{h,n}f(s,a):=\\sum_{k=0}^n \\displaystyle \\frac{{K}_h\\bigl(s-\\mathrm{s}_k,a-\\mathrm{a}_k\\bigr)f(\\mathrm{s}_k,\\mathrm{a}_k) }{\\sum_{k=0}^n {K}_h \\bigl( s-\\mathrm{s}_k,a-\\mathrm{a}_k\\bigr) },\\] To apply the kernel approximation on the action value function we notice the recursion of the TD-update and let for \\(n \\geq 1\\) \\[%\\label{eq:recKernelQ:intro} \\widehat{Q}_{h,n}(s,a)= \\widehat{Q}_{h,n-1}(s,a) + \\mathit{a}_{h,n-1}(s,a) \\Bigl( R(\\mathrm{s}_{n-1},{\\mathrm a}_{n-1})+ \\gamma {\\sup}_{a&#39; \\in A} \\hat Q_{h,n-1}(\\mathrm{s}_{n},a&#39;) - \\hat{Q}_{h,n-1}(s,a)\\Bigr).\\] with \\[%\\label{eq:upalpha:sec:carden:le:2:intro} \\mathit{a}_{h,n}(s,a)= \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\displaystyle \\frac{{K}_h\\bigl(s-\\mathrm{s}_n,a-\\mathrm{a}_n\\bigr)}{\\sum_{j=0}^n {K}_h \\bigl( s-\\mathrm{s}_j,a-\\mathrm{a}_j\\bigr) } \\quad &amp;\\text{if} \\quad \\displaystyle \\sum_{j=0}^n {K}_h \\bigl( s-\\mathrm{s}_j,a-\\mathrm{a}_j\\bigr) &gt;0 \\\\ 0 &amp;\\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right..\\] Our main result is the rate of convergence, \\(\\widehat{Q}_{h,n}(s,a)\\) to \\(Q^\\star(s,a)\\) in probability when \\(n\\) becomes large and \\(h\\) small, for all \\(s, a\\) in \\(\\overline S \\times \\overline A\\) Theorem There exists a constant \\(C\\), depending on the various parameters underpinning our assumptions, such that, for an error threshold \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), we can find \\(h_{\\varepsilon}\\) and \\(n_{\\varepsilon}\\) such that the sup* distance between \\(\\widehat{Q}_{h_\\varepsilon,n_\\varepsilon}\\) and \\(Q^\\star\\) is less than \\(C (1+\\vert \\ln(\\varepsilon)\\vert) \\varepsilon\\) on an event of probability greater than \\(1-C \\varepsilon^D\\). The number \\(n_{\\varepsilon}\\) that is necessary to do so is less than \\(\\exp(C \\vert \\ln(\\varepsilon) \\vert^3)\\).* A principle of one big jump for the branching random walk Jakob Stonner (JLU Gießen) We prove a version of Nagaev’s theorem for the branching random walk with heavy-tailed associated random walk. For a heavy-tailed random walk \\((S_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), this theorem roughly states that \\(\\mathbb{P}(S_n &gt; n\\mathbb{E}[S_1] + t) = n \\mathbb{P}(S_1 &gt; t)(1 + o(1))\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) uniformly in large \\(t &gt; 0\\), which is explained probabilistically by the principle of one big jump. For a branching random walk on \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) we consider the random measure \\(\\widehat{Z}_n = \\sum_{|u|=n} \\mathrm{e}^{-V_u} \\delta_{V_u}\\), where \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\((V_u)_{|u|=n}\\) denote the positions of the particles in the \\(n\\)-th generation. Our result then states that \\(\\widehat{Z}_n([n\\mathbb{E}[S_1] + t_n, \\infty)) = W n \\mathbb{P}(S_1 &gt; t_n)(1 + o(1))\\) in probability as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), where \\(W\\) is a non-degenerate random variable, \\(t_n \\uparrow \\infty\\) grows fast enough, and \\((S_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}\\) is the associated random walk. Dynamic Server Scheduling with Interruptible Set-up Times in a Network Dongnuan Tian (Lancaster University) We consider a dynamic scheduling problem in which a single server operates over a network to process jobs of different types arriving at designated demand points according to independent Poisson processes. Jobs accumulate waiting costs while queued at their respective locations, and the server dynamically travels around the network to process them. The travel time between nodes represents the sequence-dependent, interruptible set-up time required to switch between job types. This network-based formulation allows us to capture complex relationships in switching efforts between different tasks. We model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective of minimizing the long-run average holding cost. We prove the existence of a stationary policy that ensures system stability under a workload condition. Due to the intractability of exact solutions in large state spaces, we propose a class of index-based heuristic policies with desirable structural properties. We also discuss how these heuristics can be modified to scale effectively with problem size and demonstrate their performance through extensive numerical experiments against suitable benchmarks.

The classical example of such systems is the Asymmetric (Simple) Exclusion process (ASEP), an interacting particle system whose large-scale behaviour has fascinated probabilists and mathematicians for more than half a century. In the subcritical spatial dimension d=1, the SBE coincides with the derivative of the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, which is polynomially superdiffusive and whose fluctuations are described by the KPZ Fixed Point, while in the super-critical dimensions d&gt;2, it was recently shown to be diffusive and rescale to a biased Stochastic Heat equation. The present talk focuses on the critical dimension d=2, which falls outside of the ground-breaking theory of Regularity Structures and whose large-scale behaviour had long been open. In their seminal work, van Beijren, Kutner and Spohn conjecture that the SBE should be logarithmically superdiffusive with a precise exponent but this has only been shown up to lower order corrections (both for ASEP in a landmark paper of H.-T. Yau, and, more recently for the SPDE). We pin down the logarithmic superdiffusivity exactly by identifying the asymptotic behaviour of the so-called diffusion matrix and show that, once the logarithmic corrections to the scaling are taken into account, the solution of the SBE satisfies a central limit theorem. This is joint work with Q. Moulard and F. Toninelli. Energy propagation in stochastically perturbed harmonic chains Tomasz Komorowski (IM PAN) Nature has a hierarchical structure with macroscopic behavior arising from the dynamics of atoms and molecules. The connection between different levels of the hierarchy is however not always straightforward, as seen in the emergent phenomena, such as phase transition and heat convection. Establishing in a mathematical precise way the connection between the different levels is the central problem of rigorous statistical mechanics. One of the methods leading to such results is to introduce some stochasticity inside the system. A classical microscopic model of the thermal energy transport is provided by a chain of coupled oscillators on a integer lattice, that describes atoms (or molecules) in a crystal. We summarise some of the results obtained recently concerning the derivation of the macroscopic heat equation from the microscopic behaviour of a harmonic chain with a stochastic perturbation. We focus our attention on the emergence of macroscopic boundary conditions. The results have been obtained in collaboration with Joel Lebowitz, Stefano Olla, Marielle Simon. Critical long-range percolation Tom Hutchcroft (Caltech) Many statistical mechanics models on the lattice (including percolation, self-avoiding walk, the Ising model and so on) have natural \"long-range\" versions in which vertices interact not only with their neighbours, but with all other vertices in a way that decays with the distance. When this decay is described by a power-law, it can lead to new kinds of critical phenomena that are not present in the short-range models. I will describe a new approach to the study of these models that allows us to go well beyond what is known for short-range models, particularly in intermediate dimensions.

We present gips, an R package that automatically detects permutation symmetries among variables in a Gaussian model and uses them to constrain covariance estimation. By Bayesian inference over possible symmetry partitions, gips identifies groups of interchangeable dimensions and enforces these constraints to produce a reduced-variance estimator. In simulations, it accurately recovers true symmetries and matches popular shrinkage methods in accuracy while providing additional interpretation via symmetry structures. This poster is based on Chojecki et al. \\([2]\\), which presents the package in greater detail. gips is available on CRAN, complete with documentation \\([3]\\), and examples, enabling straightforward application in data mining, computational biology, and other fields requiring structured covariance estimation.

Our approach is fully probabilistic and builds upon the works of Huang et al. (2022) and Diakhaby et al. (2016). Reflected stochastic differential equations, driven by multiplicative Lévy noise and with singular coefficients, play an important role in our method.

P19: Accounting for reporting delays in real-time phylodynamic analyses with preferential sampling Volodymyr Minin (University of California, Irvine) stand: S5 The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that fast and accurate analysis of continually collected infectious disease surveillance data is crucial for situational awareness and policy making. Coalescent-based phylodynamic analysis can use genetic sequences of a pathogen to estimate changes in its effective population size, a measure of genetic diversity. These changes in effective population size can be connected to the changes in the number of infections in the population of interest under certain conditions. Phylodynamics is an important set of tools because its methods are often resilient to the ascertainment biases present in traditional surveillance data (e.g., preferentially testing symptomatic individuals). Unfortunately, it takes weeks or months to sequence and deposit the sampled pathogen genetic sequences into a database, making them available for such analyses. These reporting delays severely decrease precision of phylodynamic methods closer to present time, and for some models can lead to extreme biases. Here we present a method that affords reliable estimation of the effective population size trajectory closer to the time of data collection, allowing for policy decisions to be based on more recent data. Our work uses readily available historic times between sampling and reporting of sequenced samples for a population of interest, and incorporates this information into the sampling model to mitigate the effects of reporting delay in real-time analyses. We illustrate our methodology on simulated data and on SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the state of Washington in 2021 \\([1]\\).

P20: Asymptotic results for dynamic contagion processes with different exciting functions and application to risk models. Shamiksha Shamiksha (Indian Institute of Technology Delhi) stand: S6 Hawkes process is a particular class of point process (introduced by Hawkes \\([2]\\)) which is characterized by the self-exciting and/or multi-exciting property, i.e., the occurrence of future events is influenced by the past events. Initially, Hawkes and Oakes \\([3]\\) constructed the cluster form representation of the Hawkes process from a homogeneous Poisson process and used the same exciting function for the production of subsequent offspring. These processes are widely used in several fields including seismology, finance, DNA modeling, neuroscience, queuing systems and many others. In particular, the self-exciting property, and multi-exciting property property of the Hawkes processes provide a consistent model for examining the clustering of defaults during financial crises. However, defaults are also subject to external influences, thus in this regards, a new point process has been introduced by Dassios and Zhao \\([1]\\) known as the dynamic contagion process, which combines the characteristics of both self-excited and externally excited jumps. In Pandey et al. \\([4]\\), we introduced an extension of the cluster representation of dynamic contagion process in which we used different exciting functions for different generations of offspring and studied their asymptotic properties including Central Limit Theorem and Large Deviation Principle. This consideration is important in a number of fields, e.g., in seismology, where main shocks produce aftershocks with possibly different intensities. Additionally, in a financial setting, we investigated the asymptotic behavior of the ruin probability in both finite and infinite time horizons. Specifically, we considered the risk model under the assumption that the dynamics of the contagion claims arrivals have different exciting functions and examined how it affects the ruin probability.

Estimating fixation probabilities is, however, usually hindered by the lack of analytical formulas and by computational complexity of simulation-based strategies when considering large populations. In this work, we study several population genetics models where the population is divided into \\(D\\) subpopulations (called demes) consisting of two types of individuals, mutants and wild-types, that evolve through discrete Markovian updates. We prove that under certain assumptions all the considered models converge to the same diffusion approximation, which we call universal. This diffusion approximation is amenable to simulation strategies that underly methods of statistical inference while significantly reducing computational costs. In all models, each Markovian update follows two phases: First, a local growth phase in each subpopulation, where the growth of each type of individual depends on its fitness, and then a sampling phase that implements migration between subpopulations. Our proof relies on existing diffusion approximation results for degenerate diffusions, see \\([1]\\), but requires further technicalities due to fact that sample sizes in each deem are not necessarily fixed but change randomly with each update. This is joint work with Alia Abbara and Anne-Florence Bitbol at EPF Lausanne. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Ethier, S.

P23: Asymptotically Distribution-free Goodness-of-Fit Testing for Point Processes Justin Baars (Universiteit van Amsterdam) stand: S9 Consider an observation of a multivariate temporal point process \\(N\\) with law \\(\\mathcal P\\) on the time interval \\([0,T]\\). To test the null hypothesis that \\(\\mathcal P\\) belongs to a given parametric family, we construct a convergent compensated counting process to which we apply an innovation martingale transformation. We prove that the resulting process converges weakly to a standard Wiener process. Consequently, taking a suitable functional of this process yields an asymptotically distribution-free goodness-of-fit test for point processes. For several standard tests based on the increments of this transformed process, we establish consistency under alternative hypotheses. Finally, we assess the performance of the proposed testing procedure through a Monte Carlo simulation study and illustrate its practical utility with two real-data examples. P24: Non-Hermitian matrix-valued process and related measure-valued processes Satoshi Yabuoku (Fukuoka University, Japan) stand: S10 We consider the non-Hermitian matrix-valued stochastic process whose entries evolve as independent complex Brownian motions. This process is a natural time-dependent model of Ginibre ensemble in random matrix theory. Because of the non-normality of matrices, its eigenvalue processes \\((\\Lambda_j(t))_{j=1}^N\\) should be treated together with their eigenvector-overlap processes. Here, the eigenvector-overlap processes \\({\\mathcal{O}}(t)=({\\mathcal{O}}_{jk}(t))_{1\\le j,k \\le N}\\) are defined by the products of the inner products of corresponding right and left eigenvectors. Although right and left eigenvectors are defined only up to scaling, eigenvector-overlaps are invariant under such transformations, and hence they are uniquely determined. Then, we derive SDEs for the eigenvector-overlap processes as following. Theorem. The eigenvector-overlap process \\(({\\mathcal{O}}(t))_{t \\geq 0}\\) satisfies the following system of SDEs, \\[d{\\mathcal{O}}_{jk}(t) = d {\\mathcal{M}}^{{\\mathcal{O}}}_{jk}(t) +\\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{\\substack{1 \\leq \\ell, m \\leq N: \\cr \\ell \\not=j, m \\not=k}} \\frac{ {\\mathcal{O}}_{jk}(t) {\\mathcal{O}}_{\\ell m}(t) +{\\mathcal{O}}_{\\ell k}(t) {\\mathcal{O}}_{jm}(t)} {(\\Lambda_j(t)-\\Lambda_{\\ell}(t)) (\\overline{\\Lambda_k(t)}-\\overline{\\Lambda_m(t)})} dt,\\] \\(1 \\leq j, k \\leq N, t \\geq 0\\) where \\({\\mathcal{M}}^{{\\mathcal{O}}}_{jk}(t)\\) are local martingales. When we consider the time-dependent empirical measure of eigenvalues, time-dependent weighted point processes associated with the eigenvalues and eigenvector-overlaps naturally arise. These point processes are defined by generalized eigenvector-overlaps, and they form an “infinite hierarchy”. For lower levels of this hierarchy, we determine the limiting measure and compute the expected moments of the weighted point processes at each fixed time. This is based on the joint work with Syota Esaki (Oita University), Makoto Katori (Chuo University) \\([1]\\) and Jacek Małecki (Wrocław University of Science and Technology).

P25: Evolution of a quantitative trait in a metapopulation setting: Propagation of chaos meets adaptive dynamics Josué Tchouanti Fotso (LIFEWARE, Inria Center of Saclay) stand: S11 This work is about studying the role of migration as a key driver of the evolution of spatially structured populations. To this end, we consider a metapopulation setting where evolutionary processes at the level of each patch is modelled by a Moran model, which describes the evolution of a quantitative trait in a population of fixed size by two main mechanisms : trait resampling and mutations. Migrations are added in order to take into account interactions between patches and the question we would like to answer is: how do these migrations influence the long term evolution of the population at the level of a single patch and at the level of the entire metapopulation ? For this purpose, we study several scaling limits of the model. Assuming rare mutations and migrations, we adapt a technique from Champagnat &amp; Lambert \\([1]\\) in order to get a mean-field network of Trait Substitution Sequence (TSS) describing long-term successive dominant traits in each patch. We derive the propagation of chaos as the metapopulation becomes large. Patches are therefore i.i.d copies of each other, with a TSS described by a McKean-Vlasov pure jump process. In the limit where mutations have small effects and migration is further slowed down accordingly, we obtain the convergence of the TSS, in the new migration timescale, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation which can be referred to as a new canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. This equation includes an advection term representing selection, a diffusive term due to the genetic drift, and a jump term – representing the effect of migration – to a state distributed according to the law of the solution.

P27: Bell shaped sequences and first passages locations for two-dimensional random walks Jacek Wszoła (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) stand: S13 Bell-shaped functions have been studied since the 1940s and are widely used in probability theory.

We will also consider a two-dimensional random walk \\((X_n, Y_n)\\) on the lattice \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\), with diagonal jumps \\((\\pm 1, \\pm1)\\) and jump probabilities depending only on the position of the second coordinate \\(Y_n\\). The first passage location is a random variable \\(X_\\tau\\), where \\(\\tau = \\min\\{n \\geq 0: Y_n=0\\}\\) denotes the first passage time to zero.

Riesz spaces are vector spaces endowed with a partial order and where any two elements have a supremum and infimum. In this work, we overview our study of the vector space of càdlàg quasimartingales through the framework of Riesz spaces. In particular, after presenting some basic definitions and known results associated with quasimartingales, we present a result and outline our original proof stating that this space is a Riesz space, when endowed with a particular order, and that it satisfies additional properties within this framework. More specifically, this result states that the space of càdlàg quasimartingales is an order-complete Riesz space. Additionally, when endowed with a particular norm which we will define, this space is an AL-space. We then present two additional results of ours. The first includes various characterisations of the notion of singularity for càdlàg quasimartingales which we have found. The second result states that the space of càdlàg quasimartingales of class(D) is, in some specific sense, the dual space of the space of adapted, bounded, continuous processes.

The Delfino-Viti conjecture predicts that in the fine mesh limit, under suitable normalization, this probability converges to (a multiple of) the imaginary DOZZ formula from conformal field theory. We prove the Delfino-Viti conjecture, and more generally, obtain the cluster connectivity three-point function of the conformal loop ensemble. Based on joint work with Gefei Cai, Xin Sun, and Baojun Wu. Exceptional times when bi-infinite geodesics exist in dynamical last passage percolation Manan Bhatia (MIT) Exponential last passage percolation (LPP) is a canonical planar directed model of random geometry in the KPZ universality class where the Euclidean metric is distorted by i.i.d. noise. One can also consider a dynamical version of LPP, where the noise is resampled at a constant rate, thereby gradually altering the underlying geometry. In fact, LPP is known to be noise sensitive in the sense that running the dynamics for a microscopic amount of time leads to a macroscopic change in the geometry. In this talk, we shall discuss the question of the existence of exceptional times in dynamical LPP at which bi-infinite geodesics exist. For static LPP, bi-infinite geodesics almost surely do not exist as was shown in Basu-Hoffman-Sly ’18 and Balasz-Busani-Seppalainen ’19. For dynamical LPP, we show that such exceptional times are at least very close to existing; namely, we give a subpolynomial lower bound \\((\\Omega(1/\\log n))\\) on the probability that there is an exceptional time \\(t\\in [0,1]\\) at which the origin lies on a geodesic of length \\(n\\). In the other direction, for a dynamics on the related Brownian LPP model, we analyse ‘geodesic switches’ to establish that the corresponding set of exceptional times almost surely has Hausdorff dimension at most \\(1/2\\)– we expect the correct dimension to be \\(0\\) as can be gathered by an intuitive non-rigorous argument. Percolation of Gaussian free field and loop soup in dimension two Yifan Gao (City University of Hong Kong) We present some recent progress in the study of two-sided level set percolation of GFF. Moreover, we show that the level-set percolation for the occupation field of random walk loop soup at subcritical intensity exhibits a non-trivial phase transition. Along the way, some useful properties and estimates for the four-arm events in the loop soups are derived.

For this purpose, a variety of models associated with non-Hermitian operators and matrices have been extensively studied in a new research field called non-Hermitian physics. Motivated by such a new trend, we will report the stochastic analysis of non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion (BM) and related stochastic processes. In contrast to Dyson’s BM models describing the eigenvalue processes of the Hermitian matrix-valued BMs, the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of the eigenvalue processes are coupled with those of the eigenvector-overlap processes. The latter cause random time-change to the former. We also discuss non-normal and defective matrix-valued dynamical systems in order to demonstrate the importance of the notion of pseudospectra in addition to eigenvalues.

Collisions of the supercritical Keller-Segel particle system Yoan Tardy (CMAP (Polytechnique)) We study a particle system naturally associated to the \\(2\\)-dimensional Keller-Segel equation. It consists of \\(N\\) Brownian particles in the plane, interacting through a binary attraction in \\(\\theta /Nr\\), where \\(r\\) stands for the distance between two particles. When the intensity \\(\\theta\\) of this attraction is greater than \\(2\\), this particle system explodes in finite time. We assume that \\(N&gt;3\\theta\\) and study in details what happens near explosion. There are two slightly different scenarios, depending on the values of \\(N\\) and \\(\\theta\\), here is one: at explosion, a cluster consisting of precisely \\(k_0\\) particles emerges, for some deterministic \\(k_0\\ge 7\\) depending on \\(N\\) and \\(\\theta\\). Just before explosion, there are infinitely many \\((k_0-1)\\)-ary collisions. There are also infinitely many \\((k_0-2)\\)-ary collisions before each \\((k_0-1)\\)-ary collision. And there are infinitely many binary collisions before each \\((k_0-2)\\)-ary collision. Finally, collisions of subsets of \\(3,\\dots,k_0-3\\) particles never occur. The other scenario is similar except that there are no \\((k_0-2)\\)-ary collisions.

In this talk, we study stability of optimisers and exponential convergence of Sinkhorn’s algorithm, that is at the heart of the success of entropic regularisation in machine learning and engineering applications. In the first part of the talk, we will illustrate how semiconcavity of dual optimal variables, known as entropic potentials, plays a key role in establishing tight stability bounds and the convergence of Sinkhorn iterates with sharp rates.

Linear convergence of proximal descent schemes on the Wasserstein space Mateusz Majka (Heriot-Watt University) In this talk, I will first introduce the problem of training mean-field neural networks as an infinite-dimensional entropy regularized optimization problem on the Wasserstein space, i.e, \\[\\min_{\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}_2(\\mathbb R^d)} F^{\\sigma}(\\mu), \\text{ with } F^{\\sigma}(\\mu) := F(\\mu) + \\sigma\\operatorname{KL}(\\mu|\\pi).\\] I will then explain how to solve this problem by utilizing the Wasserstein gradient flow, and, in particular, how to obtain the convergence rate of the flow under different notions of convexity. I will then proceed to discuss the results from \\([2]\\) on proximal descent methods, inspired by the minimizing movement scheme introduced by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto (JKO), for optimizing entropy-regularized functionals on the Wasserstein space. In particular, the focus will be on the splitting scheme defined by the following update rule: Given a step-size \\(\\tau &gt; 0\\) and starting from \\(\\mu^0 \\in \\mathcal{P}_2(\\mathbb R^d)\\), perform a gradient descent on \\(F\\): \\[\\nu^{n+1} = \\left(I_d-\\tau\\nabla \\frac{\\delta F}{\\delta \\mu}(\\mu^n, \\cdot)\\right)_{\\#}\\mu^n\\] and then perform a JKO step starting from \\(\\nu^{n+1}\\): \\[\\mu^{n+1} = \\operatorname{argmin}_{\\mu \\in \\mathcal{P}_2(\\mathbb R^d)} \\left\\{\\sigma \\operatorname{KL}(\\mu|\\pi) + \\frac{1}{2\\tau}\\mathcal{W}_2^2(\\mu, \\nu^{n+1})\\right\\}\\,.\\] I will explain how to establish linear convergence of such schemes under flat convexity assumptions, thereby relaxing the common reliance on geodesic convexity. The analysis from \\([2]\\) circumvents the need for discrete-time adaptations of the Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI) such as in \\([4]\\). Instead, we leverage a uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and the entropy \"sandwich\" lemma, extending the analysis for the Wasserstein gradient flow from \\([3]\\) and \\([1]\\). The major challenge in the proof via LSI is to show that the relative Fisher information is well-defined at every step of the scheme. Since the relative entropy is not Wasserstein differentiable, we need to prove that along the scheme the iterates belong to a certain class of Sobolev regularity, and hence the relative entropy has a unique Wasserstein sub-gradient, and that the relative Fisher information is indeed finite.

Information Velocity (IV) has emerged as a critical metric for quantifying the speed at which information can reliably propagate through cascaded and relay networks under such constraints. While prior art was focused on single-message transmission, real-world applications often involve continuous message streams, necessitating a broader analytical framework. In this work, we derive IV bounds for canonical network topologies, including parallel, InTree and OutTree networks, modeled as independent servers with i.i.d. exponential processing times where the arrival process is assumed to be a Poisson process (independent of the processing times of the servers). We derive bounds on the anycast and multicast IV for continuous message streams. Our results provide theoretical insights into delay-limited communication and offer practical applications in distributed AI, computing, and real-time edge inference. Inference in dynamic random graphs Michel Mandjes (Leiden University) The bulk of the random graph literature concerns models that are of an inherently static nature, in that features of the random graph at a single point in time are considered. There are strong practical motivations, however, to consider random graphs that are stochastically evolving, so as to model networks’ inherent dynamics. In this talk I’ll start by briefly discussing a set of dynamic random graph mechanisms and their probabilistic properties. Key results cover functional diffusion limits for subgraph counts (describing the behaviour around the mean) and a sample-path large-deviation principle (describing the rare-event behaviour, thus extending the seminal result for the static case developed by Chatterjee and Varadhan). The main part of my talk will be about estimation of the model parameters from partial information. We for instance demonstrate how the model’s underlying parameters can be estimated from just snapshots of the number of edges. We also consider settings in which particles move around on a dynamically evolving random graph, and in which the graph dynamics are inferred from the movements of the particles (i.e., not observing the graph process).

Consider a family of coalescing Brownian motions started from every point in the subset \\(\\{ (0,x) : x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}\\) of \\([0,\\infty) \\times \\mathbb{R}\\) and proceeding according to the following rule: the interval \\(\\{t\\} \\times [L_t,U_t]\\) between two consecutive Brownian motions instantaneously ‘fragments’ at rate \\(R(U_t - L_t)\\). At such a fragmentation event at a time \\(t\\), we initiate new coalescing Brownian motions from each of the points \\(\\{ (t,x) : x \\in [L_t,U_t]\\}\\). The resulting process, which we call the \\(R\\)-marble, is easily constructed when \\(R\\) is bounded, and may be considered a random subset of the Brownian web. Under mild conditions, we show that it is possible to construct the \\(R\\)-marble when \\(R\\) is unbounded as a limit as \\(n \\to \\infty\\) of \\(R_n\\)-marbles where \\(R_n(g) = R(g) \\wedge n\\). The behaviour of this limiting process is mainly determined by the shape of \\(R\\) near zero. The most interesting case occurs when the limit \\(\\lim_{g \\downarrow 0} g^2 R(g) = \\lambda\\) exists in \\((0,\\infty)\\), in which case we find a phase transition. For \\(\\lambda \\geq 6\\), the limiting object is indistinguishable from the Brownian web, whereas if \\(\\lambda &lt; 6\\), then the limiting object is a nontrivial stochastic process with large gaps. When \\(R(g) = \\lambda/g^2\\), the \\(R\\)-marble is a self-similar stochastic process which we refer to as the Brownian marble with parameter \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\). We give an explicit description of the space-time correlations of the Brownian marble, which can be described in terms of an object we call the Brownian vein; a spatial version of a recurrent extension of a killed Bessel-\\(3\\) process. Wasserstein \\(L^1\\) convergence of penalized Markov processes Nicolas Champagnat (Centre Inria de l’Université de Lorraine) We consider a Markov process living in some space \\(E\\), and killed (penalized) at a rate depending on its position. In the last decade, several conditions have been given ensuring that the law of the process conditioned on survival converges to a quasi-stationary distribution exponentially fast in total variation distance. In this talk, we will present very simple examples of penalized Markov process whose conditional law cannot converge in total variation, and we will give a sufficient condition implying contraction and convergence of the conditional law in Wasserstein \\(L^1\\) (Monge-Kantorovich) distance to a unique quasi-stationary distribution. Our criterion also imply a first-order expansion of the probability of survival, the ergodicity in Wasserstein distance of the \\(Q\\)-process, i.e. the process conditioned to never be killed, and quasi-ergodicity in Wasserstein distance. We then apply this criterion to several examples, including Bernoulli convolutions and piecewise deterministic Markov processes of the form of switched dynamical systems, for which convergence in total variation is not possible. This is joint work with Edouard Strickler (CNRS, Université de Lorraine) and Denis Villemonais (Université de Lorraine). On the simulation of quasi-stationary distributions Bertrand Cloez (INRAE) In this presentation, we will review some theoretical results on algorithms for simulating quasi-sationary distributions. Among these algorithms, we will focus on two types. The first is a particle system with mean-field interaction, commonly known as the Fleming-Viot algorithm. The second is a time-reinforced process whose analysis is based on stochastic approximation algorithms.

We prove that it is sufficient for the entries of the matrix to have finite only the 4-th moment in order for the convergence to hold in probability. Our approach covers the cases of random symmetric or non-symmetric matrices whose variance profile is given by a step or a continuous function, random band matrices whose bandwidth is proportional to their dimension, random Gram triangular matrices and more.

I will present results describing the limiting spectral distribution of these matrices, as the diagram is scaled by a growing factor \\(N\\).

The spectrum of dense kernel-based random graphs Michele Salvi (University of Rome, Tor Vergata) We study a broad class of inhomogeneous spatial random graphs, including long-range and scale-free percolation and preferential attachment-like models (see session IS07 for more details!). Vertices are placed on the discrete d-dimensional torus and are equipped with heavy tailed random weights. The probability of linking any pair of vertices decays in their distance but increases as a function of the weights. We focus on the adjacency matrix of such graphs in the dense regime and prove that, as the size of the torus goes to infinity, the empirical spectral distribution converges. The corresponding limiting measure is given by an operator-valued semicircle law that we show to be absolutely continuous and to have finite second moment, even when the weights have infinite variance. We characterize its Stieltjes transform by a fixed point equation in an appropriate Banach space. Based on a joint work with A. Cipriani, R. S. Hazra and N. Malhotra.

A common feature of these particle systems is a lack of explicit invariant measures in general. This is also the source of the key technical difficulties that are ultimately resolved by analysis of the associated Kolmogorov equations.

On the global solutions of the KPZ fixed point Ofer Busani (University of Edinburgh) The Kardar–Parisi–Zhang (KPZ) fixed point is a fundamental random process that arises as the universal scaling limit for a broad class of 1+1-dimensional stochastic growth models. A key feature of the KPZ fixed point is the conservation of the slope of the initial condition, which prompts the natural question: for a fixed realization of the system, how many global (bi-infinite in time) solutions exist with a given slope? Previous work \\([2,1]\\) has established the existence of a “good” set of slopes for which the “one force–one solution” principle applies—namely, each such slope yields a unique global solution. However, beyond this good set, little is known. In particular, while it is known that uniqueness fails for “bad” slopes, the number and structure of these non-unique global solutions is unknown. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of global solutions to the KPZ fixed point with a prescribed slope. In particular, we show that for every bad slope, there exist infinitely many distinct global solutions. At the heart of the proof is a bijection between global solutions and certain bi-infinite interfaces.

The method embeds a Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition (SKPD) of the coefficient tensor within the two‑step MtMBSP strategy—sure screening followed by refitted posterior sampling. Each coefficient tensor is expressed through a Tucker expansion composed of sparse Kronecker products, and parsimony is induced by Truncated Poisson–Binomial–Normal (TPBN) shrinkage priors. Posterior inference is performed by an efficient Polya–Gamma‑augmented Gibbs sampler. We prove that SKPD‑MtMBSP preserves the sure‑screening property and achieves posterior contraction even when the number of tensor elements \\(p\\) grows exponentially with sample size \\(n\\). Simulations and analyses of ADNI and OASIS MRI data demonstrate high predictive accuracy for both and binary responses while reliably recovering the underlying brain image tensor structure under extreme dimensionality. Bayesian Sparse Kronecker product decomposition Shao Hsuan Wang (National Central University, Taiwan) Bayesian Sparse Kronecker product decomposition The Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition (SKPD) for tensor data was introduced by Sanyou Wu and Long Feng (2023). This method represents the first frequentist framework designed for signal region detection in high-resolution, high-order image regression problems. Their work demonstrated the strong performance of SKPD in various applications. In this presentation, we will introduce a Bayesian version of SKPD, referred to as Bayesian SKPD. From a Bayesian perspective, we apply a three-parameter beta-normal prior family to the parameters of interest. Additionally, we address tensor regression data with mixed-type responses using Polya-Gamma augmentation. This approach allows us to give credible region detection through direct Gibbs sampling. The theoretical results will be presented, and we will demonstrate the effectiveness of Bayesian SKPD using real brain imaging data from the OASIS. Low-rank regularization of Fréchet regression models for distribution function response Kyunghee Han (University of Illinois Chicago) Fréchet regression has emerged as a useful tool for modeling non-Euclidean response variables associated with Euclidean covariates. In this work, we propose a global Fréchet regression estimation method that incorporates low-rank regularization. Focusing on distribution function responses, we demonstrate that leveraging the low-rank structure of the model parameters enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of model fitting. Through theoretical analysis of the large-sample properties, we show that the proposed method enables more robust modeling and estimation than standard dimension reduction techniques. We also present numerical experiments that evaluate the finite-sample performance to support our findings.

Normal approximation for exponential random graphs Xiao Fang (The Chinese University of Hong Kong) The question of whether the central limit theorem (CLT) holds for the total number of edges in exponential random graph models (ERGMs) in the subcritical region of parameters has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish the CLT. As a result of our proof, we also derive a convergence rate for the CLT, an explicit formula for the asymptotic variance, and the CLT for general subgraph counts. To establish our main result, we develop Stein’s method for the normal approximation of general functionals of nonlinear exponential families of random variables, which is of independent interest. In addition to ERGMs, our general theorem can also be applied to other models. A key ingredient needed in our proof for the ERGM is a higher-order concentration inequality, which was known in a subset of the subcritical region called Dobrushin’s uniqueness region. We use Stein’s method to partially generalize such inequalities to the subcritical region.

A branching random walk with noisy selection Zsófia Talyigás (University of Vienna) There have been a lot of recent progress on branching particle systems with selection, in particular on the \\(N\\)-particle branching random walk (\\(N\\)-BRW). In the \\(N\\)-BRW, \\(N\\) particles have locations on the real line at all times. At each time step, every particle generates a number of children, and each child has a random displacement from its parent’s location. Then among the children only the \\(N\\) rightmost are selected to survive and reproduce in the next generation. In this talk we will investigate a noisy version of the \\(N\\)-BRW. In this model the \\(N\\) surviving particles are selected at random from the children in such a way, that particles more to the right on the real line are more likely to be selected. I will present some recent results on the asymptotic behaviour of this particle system as \\(N\\) goes to infinity; including the distribution of the \\(N\\) particles on the real line and the genealogical properties of the system.

While the simplest inflationary models predict nearly Gaussian fluctuations, more sophisticated scenarios can give rise to measurable non-Gaussian features. In particular, the local model of non-Gaussianity introduces a quadratic correction to an underlying Gaussian field, leading to non-trivial three-point correlations encapsulated by the CMB bispectrum. To estimate \\(f_{\\operatorname{NL}}\\) efficiently, Komatsu, Spergel, and Wandelt introduced a class of statistically optimal and computationally tractable estimators—now known as KSW estimators—that exploit spherical harmonic decompositions and rotational invariance through Wigner-3j symbols. In this paper, we study KSW-like estimators, establishing a quantitative central limit theorem (CLT) by applying fourth-moment theorems from Wiener chaos theory. Our analysis demonstrates asymptotic normality for this class of estimators and provides explicit convergence rates in terms of the decay of fourth cumulants.

Scaling limit of dependent random walks Jeonghwa Lee (University of North Carolina Wilmington) Recently, a generalized Bernoulli process (GBP) was developed as a stationary binary sequence that can have long-range dependence, and it was further broadened to include various covariance functions. In this work, we find the scaling limits of dependent random walks that follow GBPs and the dependence structure of the limiting processes. We show that the second-type Mittag-Leffler process and exponential process arise as the limiting processes. Compound processes are considered with a Levy process subordinated to the cumulative sum in GBP, and the asymptotic properties and dependence structure of the subordinated processes are discussed. Applications of GBP are provided with datasets in economics and horticulture.

We suggest to improve theoretical and experimental analysis of ergodicity used in single particle tracking by incorporating mean squared increments (MSI) for comparison with time-ensemble average mean squared displacement (TEAMSD). Moreover, by using several examples of the generic random motions in complex systems we demonstrate serious drawbacks of the routine analysis based on the comparison of mean squared displacement (MSD) with TEAMSD. Furthermore, we show that the concept of stochastic self-similarity is needed for the description of random motions in complex systems. Tempered Heavy-Tailed Correlated Noise in Stochastic Optimization Theory Farzad Sabzikar (Iowa State University) In modern AI, efficiently optimizing complex non-convex functions is a critical challenge, often demanding vast computational resources and innovative approaches to avoid getting trapped in local minima. Past studies have leveraged fractional Gaussian noise to enhance stochastic gradient descent—demonstrating its ability to overcome obstacles and escape saddle points in intricate landscapes. However, these methods can still fall short in balancing exploration with rapid convergence. To bridge this gap, we analyze a continuous-time stochastic process driven by tempered fractional stable noise (TFSN). This noise model extends the traditional fractional Gaussian framework by integrating heavy-tailed distributions with a tempering mechanism, effectively capturing both gradual long-range dependencies and sudden extreme fluctuations in complex systems. We develop a discretization strategy that leverages the unique properties of TFSN, which underpins the formulation of our new algorithm, tempered fractional perturbed gradient descent (TFPGD). In this study, we construct a theoretical framework for the practical application of TFSN in stochastic optimization. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that TFPGD achieves faster convergence rates, higher success ratios, and more efficient escape from local minima compared to the state-of-the-art fractional version (FPGD). Mean square displacement analysis for heterogeneous anomalous diffusion Jakub Ślęzak (Hugo Steinhaus Center, Wrocław University of Science and Technology) Mean square displacement (MSD) is a fundamental tool in the analysis of diffusion in complex media. When the system is heterogeneous, as much information as possible must be extracted from each single trajectory, which often have short lengths. This is made by time-averaging squared increments, and then the main line of inquiry is fitting the shape of the obtained time averaged MSD values in the log-log space. However, classical regression methods are not suited for this problem due to the correlations introduced during time-averaging and also intrinsic to anomalous diffusion systems. We analyse how to enhance it using custom generalised least squares method (GLS) which does not have such limitations and consequently can reduce the variance and bias of the diffusion parameter estimates, especially for short (\\(\\approx 100\\) points) and ultra short (\\(\\approx 10\\) points) trajectories. The method is mostly automatic and does not require supervision. It also enables us to predict the estimation errors which we use to reconstruct the underlying particle ensemble structure.

This machinery opens new avenues of research that allow the use of modern techniques from one field to another. One aspect of this research direction is centered in an interacting particle systems model, namely the Dyson Brownian motion.

Nonlinear Stochastic Filtering with Volterra Gaussian noises Andrea Iannucci (Imperial College London) We consider a nonlinear filtering problem for a signal–observation system driven by a Volterra-type Gaussian rough path, whose sample paths may exhibit greater roughness than those of Brownian motion. The observation process includes a Volterra-type drift, introducing both memory effects and low regularity in the dynamics. We prove well-posedness of the associated rough differential equations and the Kallianpur–Striebel. We then establish robustenss properties of the filter and study the existence, smoothness, and time regularity of its density using partial Malliavin calculus. Finally, we show that, in the one-dimensional case, the density of the unnormalized filter solves a rough partial differential equation, providing a rough-path analogue of the Zakai equation. This is a joint work with Thomas Cass and Dan Crisan Asymptotic behavior of the Brownian motion with singular drifts Adina Oprisan (New Mexico State University) We discuss the influence of a power law drift on the exit time of the Brownian motion from the half line when the order of the drift at 0 and infinity is different. We find that the first hitting time of 0 is finite almost surely, even when the drift near 0 is positive and unbounded, and study the asymptotic behavior of the process at the time of hitting. We find that the behavior of the process near the origin does not influence the time to hit 0 over long time periods and derive subexponential estimates for the tail distribution of the hitting time. Our results extend to the case in which the drifts are regularly varying functions at 0 respectively infinity. This talk is based on a joint work with Dante DeBlassie and Robert Smits.

In this talk, we identify the upper large deviation probability for the number of edges in such graphs and show that the mechanism behind the large deviation is based on a condensation effect. Loosely speaking, the mechanism randomly selects a finite number of vertices and increases their power, so that they connect to a macroscopic number of vertices in the graph, while the other vertices retain a degree close to their expectation and thus make no more than the expected contribution to the large deviation event. The focus in this talk is on GIRGs but our result covers a range of models such as the Boolean model with heavy-tailed radius distribution and the age-dependent random connection model. This is joint work with Remco van der Hofstad, Pim van der Hoorn, Neeladri Maitra and Peter Mörters. Emergence of heavy-tailed cascades in flow networks through a unified stochastic overload framework. Agnieszka Janicka (Eindhoven University of Technology) From power blackouts to traffic jams and financial crises, cascading failures pose a persistent threat to networks. These events rarely remain isolated — an initial failure can propagate through the system, leading to widespread disruption. Notably, across domains, the associated costs often follow heavy-tailed distributions. Our work provides a mathematically rigorous modeling framework that explains the emergence of this phenomenon. In this talk, I will present our stochastic, multi-commodity model for overload cascading failures — events triggered when flows exceed component capacities. Flows and resources are allocated optimally, following the principle of minimum energy dissipation. This formulation offers a flexible, yet analytically tractable framework applicable across diverse systems. Our results suggest that, despite domain-specific complexities, a common underlying driver — exogenous heavy-tailed inputs — may be responsible for the heavy-tailed nature of cascade costs. We derive probabilistic results that characterize when and why these costs inherit the input’s tail behavior. In particular, we show that large costs arise with high probability when a single location exhibits disproportionately high resource requirements — a phenomenon reminiscent of the catastrophe principle. The analysis also relies on continuity and scale-invariance properties of the cascade cost function, which we establish for several broad classes of modeling choices. This work deepens our understanding of cascading failures in complex systems and provides a unifying framework for analyzing large-scale disruptions, laying the groundwork for resilience analysis and policy design.

One the vertices serves as a ‘sink’, where particles are removed from the system. Starting with a configuration of only S particles, at discrete time steps an A particle is added, and the system is allowed to stabilise to a new all-S state.

(Joint work with M.W. Elvidge.) The density conjecture for activated random walk Tobias Johnson (College of Staten Island (CUNY)) Physicists Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld in the 1980s proposed “self-organized criticality” as an explanation for why systems in nature with no obvious phase transition can exhibit self-similarity and power-law tails reminiscent of statistical mechanics systems at criticality. Based on simulations, they and others proposed that simple mathematical models of sandpiles drive themselves to criticality, in various senses. These predictions have been quite difficult to confirm mathematically. We consider activated random walk (ARW), a sandpile model that seems to have some universality. In dimension one, we prove the density conjecture: ARW on a finite interval with particles added in the middle and destroyed at the edges naturally drives itself to the critical density of ARW on the infinite line. This is the first rigorous proof of any sandpile model driving itself to a critical state. We also prove that the system mixes as soon as enough particles are added to bring the density up to criticality. Joint work with Chris Hoffman, Matt Junge, and Josh Meisel. Self-organized criticality and avalanches in 2D forest fires Pierre Nolin (City University of Hong Kong) Bernoulli percolation can be used to analyze planar forest fire (or epidemics) processes. In such processes, all vertices of a lattice are initially vacant, and then become occupied at rate \\(1\\). If an occupied vertex is hit by lightning, which occurs at a (typically very small) rate \\(\\zeta\\), all the vertices connected to it burn immediately, i.e. they become vacant.   We want to analyze the behavior of such processes near and beyond criticality, that is, when large components of occupied sites appear. They display a form of self-organized criticality as \\(\\zeta \\searrow 0\\), where the phase transition of Bernoulli percolation plays an important role. In particular, a peculiar and striking phenomenon arises, that we call “near-critical avalanches”.   This talk is based on joint works with Rob van den Berg (CWI and VU, Amsterdam) and with Wai-Kit Lam (National Taiwan University, Taipei).

Extremes of Brownian decision trees Nikolai Kriukov (University of Amsterdam) We consider a Brownian motion with linear drift that splits at fixed time points into a fixed number of branches, which may depend on the branching points. For this process, which we shall refer as the Brownian decision tree, we investigate the exact asymptotics of high exceedance probabilities in finite time horizon, including: the probability that at least one branch exceeds some high threshold, the probability that the largest distance between branches gets large and the probability that all branches simultaneously exceeds some high barrier.

Various graph families—such as K-chains and Erdős–Rényi random graphs—have been studied and shown to achieve strong performance. However, the question of what is the optimal graph design has remained open. In this paper, we resolve this question by proving that random regular graphs are asymptotically optimal. Goggin’s corrected Kalman Filter: Guarantees and Filtering Regimes Itai Gurvich (Northwestern University) In this paper we revisit a non-linear filter for non-Gaussian noises that was introduced by Goggin in 1992. Goggin proved that transforming the observations by the score function and then applying the Kalman Filter (KF) to the transformed observations results in an asymptotically optimal filter. In the current paper, we study the convergence rate of Goggin’s filter in a pre-limit setting that allows us to study a range of signal-to-noise regimes which includes, as a special case, Goggin’s setting. Our guarantees are explicit in the level of observation noise, and importantly, we do not assume Gaussianity of the noises. Our proofs build on combining simple tools from two separate literature streams. One is a general posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound for filtering. The other is convergence-rate bounds in the Fisher information central limit theorem. Along the way, we also study filtering regimes for linear state-space models, characterizing clearly degenerate regimes—where trivial filters are nearly optimal—and a balanced regime, which is where Goggin’s filter has the most value.

The discrepancy between min-max statistics of Gaussian and Gaussian-subordinated matrices Nicola Turchi (Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca) We compute quantitative bounds for measuring the discrepancy between the distributions of two min-max statistics involving either pairs of Gaussian random matrices, or one Gaussian and one Gaussiansubordinated random matrix. In the fully Gaussian setup, our approach allows us to recover quantitative versions of well-known inequalities by Gordon, thus generalising the quantitative version of the Sudakov-Fernique inequality deduced by Chatterjee. On the other hand, the Gaussian-subordinated case yields generalizations of estimates obtained in the framework of the Chernozhukov-Chetverikov-Kato (CCK) theory. As applications, we establish comparison bounds for order statistics of random vectors and fourth moment bounds for matrices of multiple stochastic Wiener-Itô integrals. Lipschitz-Killing curvatures for excursion sets of spin spherical random fields Francesca Pistolato (Université du Luxembourg) In the present era, there is a growing interest in modeling data not only with scalar values but also with more sophisticated algebraic structures. An important example are spin spherical random fields, that can be defined as random sections of a bundle of the 2-sphere. These fields manifest in both gravitational lensing data and Cosmic Microwave Background polarization data, which can be seen as vectors on the complex plane. Motivated by studying anisotropies and divergence from Gaussianity of the latter, we study the excursion sets of their real part by means of their Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, that are geometric functionals such as, in dimension 3, the volume, the surface area, the cross-sectional diameter and the Euler characteristic. Without requiring the isotropy of the field, it is possible to compute explicitly the expectation of such functionals in terms of the spin parameter and the level of the excursion. Moreover, it is possible to explicit a chaotic decomposition for the second curvature, the surface area, providing a small step forward in the study of second-order asymptotics of such functionals in the high-frequency regime. The talk is based on joint works with M. Stecconi.

Kozubowski (University of Nevada, Reno) The normal mean-variance mixture model is a versatile tool in probability and statistics, widely used in areas such as hierarchical modeling, Bayesian inference, stochastic processes, and machine learning. We explore an extension where the mixing is linked to the eigenvalues of the Gaussian covariance matrix, leading to multiple-scaled Gaussian mixture models - recently proposed for more flexible clustering and classification (see, e.g., \\([1-5]\\)). We further modify this framework to define a multivariate distribution uniquely determined by the underlying Gaussian covariance matrix. Key properties such as infinite divisibility and the related multivariate Lévy processes are discussed, highlighting their relevance in stochastic modeling. This is a joint work with Amos Natido.

Lévy processes with values in the cone of non-negatively defined matrices Krzysztof Podgórski (Lund University) The infinite divisibility of the exponential distribution underlies the construction of the classical gamma Lévy motion. A natural generalization of the exponential distribution to the matrix-valued setting exists; however, it is not infinitely divisible and therefore cannot be directly used to define a matrix-valued gamma motion, see \\([3]\\). In existing literature, see \\([1]\\), the Lévy–Khintchine representation on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices has been employed to construct infinitely divisible matrix-valued analogues of gamma distributions. In this work, we propose three alternative approaches that yield distinct infinitely divisible distributions on the cone, while retaining the direct use of the natural matrix-valued exponential distribution. The first approach introduces a novel Lévy motion with multivariate argument and thus defined on the non-negative orthant, resulting in a multivariate shape (divisibility) parameter. This construction reveals a simple relationship with the classical matrix gamma distribution, which has a scalar shape parameter. The second and third constructions involve one-dimensional divisibility parameters and can be seen as natural matrix-valued extensions of the Bondesson shot-noise representation of the one-dimensional gamma motion, see \\([2]\\), where the matrix exponential distribution governs the jump sizes. Compared to prior constructions, the proposed models offer advantages such as explicit analytical expressions for many of their properties and straightforward simulation algorithms. These features make the models well-suited for applications in stochastic modeling, especially where stochastic integration is required and both theoretical analysis and computation must remain tractable.

Theory and Applications. Agnieszka Wyłomańska (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) Anomalous diffusion processes have been widely discussed in the literature. The process \\(\\{X(t)\\}\\) is labelled as anomalous diffusive if its second moment grows in time as a power-law function, i.e., \\[\\label{eq1} \\mathbb{E} \\left(X^2(t)\\right)=2Dt^{\\alpha} \\,,\\] where \\(\\alpha\\in[0,2]\\) is the anomalous exponent and \\(D\\in[0,\\infty)\\) is the generalized diffusion coefficient (called also diffusion coefficient). The classical example of the anomalous diffusive class is the fractional Brownian motion (FBM) \\(\\{B_{H}(t)~t\\geq 0\\}\\) that is continuous centred Gaussian process defined through the integral representation \\([1]\\) \\[\\tag{1} B_{H}(t) =A_{H}\\Bigg[\\int_{0}^{t}(t-u)^{H-1/2}d\\tilde{B}(u) +\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\mspace{-4mu}\\left((t-u)^{H-1/2}-(-u)^{H-1/2}\\right)d\\tilde{B}(u)\\Bigg] \\mspace{-4mu},\\] where \\(0&lt;H&lt;1\\) is the Hurst exponent. The process \\(\\{\\tilde{B}(t),~t\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\) is the extension of ordinary Brownian motion to the negative time axis defined as \\[\\tilde{B}(t)= \\begin{cases} B_1(t) ~ \\mbox{for}~t&gt;0,\\\\ B_2(-t) ~\\mbox{for}~ t\\leq 0, \\end{cases}\\] where \\(\\{B_1(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) and \\(\\{B_2(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) are two independent ordinary Brownian motions. Let us note that the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) determines the anomalous diffusion behavior of FBM and \\(\\alpha\\) in the equation \\((1)\\) is equal to \\(2H\\). However, recent empirical findings suggest that classical anomalous diffusion models often fail to adequately capture the underlying dynamics of such phenomena. Consequently, contemporary research has proposed numerous modifications to these models in order to better represent the specific behaviors observed in real data. One such modification involves the incorporation of random parameters that govern anomalous diffusion within traditional models. During the presentation, we introduce a novel conceptual approach to anomalous diffusion modeling, with a particular focus on FBM and its multifractional extension. In these models, the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) is replaced by a suitable randomly chosen variable \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) or a stochastic process \\(\\{\\mathcal{H}(t)\\}\\), respectively. We examine the fundamental probabilistic properties of the models discussed and discuss methodologies for their application to empirical data. The presentation concludes with several illustrative examples based on real-world datasets.

Fundamental theorem for mean square convergence of SDEs on Riemannian manifolds Alexander Lewis (Georg-August-Universität Göttingen) The error rate for the Euler(-Murayama) approximation of SDEs on Riemannian manifolds in the weak sense has been established in \\([1]\\) and was found to be of global rate 1; reflecting the classical result known Euclidean space. However, strong convergence rates of the Euler scheme have yet to be derived. Though based on intuition, it is not unreasonable to expect that the manifold scheme has the same global rate as its Euclidean counterpart of 1/2. By following closely to the approach laid out in the seminal works of Milstein, we show how to generate high order strong schemes on a Riemannian manifold with empty cut-locus. In particular, we show that the Euler scheme has global rate 1/2. Furthermore, we present the Milstein correction to the Euler scheme which yields a scheme of global order 1. Finally, we will formulate the manifold generalisation of the fundamental theorem of strong convergence, allowing us to obtain global convergence rates for a wide range of numerical schemes. If time permits, I will also present numerical experiments which illustrate the theoretical guarantees.

Kinetic Langevin equations on Lie groups with a geometric mechanics approach Erwin Luesink (University of Amsterdam) Kinetic Langevin equations are used for sampling from distributions and can employed in spaces with nontrivial curvature. On Lie groups, these equations can be solved with efficient numerical algorithms. In this talk, we discuss how the kinetic Langevin equations can be viewed within the framework of stochastic geometric mechanics. The benefit of doing so is that one obtains a physical interpretation as well as a multiplicative noise version of the kinetic Langevin equations.

Free probability: Free probability, developed in large part by Voiculescu, is a theory of non-commuting random variables which can be used the describe the large-\\(n\\) behavior of certain \\(n \\times n\\) random matrices. The idea is that the algebra of classical random variables \\(L^\\infty(\\Omega,P)\\) is replaced by a non-commutative von Neumann algebra and the expectation is replaced by a tracial state \\(\\tau: M \\to \\mathbb{C}\\). The role of the normal distribution from classical probability is played by Wigner’s semicircular distribution, and classical independence is replaced by free independence, a condition motivated by free products of groups. In particular, a \\(d\\)-variable free Brownian motion is a process \\(S_t = (S_t^{(1)},\\dots,S_t^{(d)})\\) where the increments are freely independent and the different coordinates are also freely independent. A free Brownian motion describes the large-\\(n\\) behavior of a Brownian motion on the space \\(M_n(\\mathbb{C})_{\\operatorname{sa}}^d\\) of \\(d\\)-tuples of self-adjoint matrices. Stochastic optimization problems: We consider stochastic optimization problems that using both a free Brownian motion \\(S_t\\) and a classical Brownian \\(W_t\\); these processes are thus classical random objects taking values in a tracial von Neumann algebra, equipped with both classical and non-commutative filtrations. We consider processes satisfying \\[dX_t = \\beta_F dS_t + \\beta_C \\,dW_t + \\alpha_t\\,dt,\\] where \\(\\alpha_t\\) is a control that we want to choose. The stochastic optimization problem is \\[\\text{minimize } \\mathbb{E} [\\int_0^1 L(X_t,\\alpha_t)\\,dt + g(X_1)] \\text{ over } \\alpha,\\] where the running cost \\(L\\) and the terminal cost \\(g\\) are given functions that can be evaluated on non-commuting random variables. The inclusion of both \\(S_t\\) and \\(W_t\\) is motivated by mean field game theory (see \\([2]\\)): The \\(S_t\\) represents individual noise associated to a single player (motivated by the Brownian motion that affects all the matrix entries), and the \\(W_t\\) represents a common noise that affects all the players (which in the matrix model would be a random scalar multiple of the identity matrix added to each of the \\(d\\) matrices). Results: We study the value of the minimization problem as a function of the initial condition \\(X_0\\), and show that it satisfies a non-commutative version of the dynamic programming principle and Hamilton–Jacobi equation. A key challenge is that the value of the optimization problem may depend on the choice of ambient von Neumann algebra \\(M\\) and filtration. We thus take the infimum over all choices of \\(M\\) as well, and analyze how to join together different given choices of \\(M\\). However, under certain convexity assumptions, the answer is the same regardless of the choice of \\(M\\), and in this case we can show that the value of the free stochastic optimal problem gives the large-\\(n\\) limit of matrix optimal control problems. We remark that special cases of this setup relate closely with free entropy theory and the large deviation principle of Biane, Capitaine, and Guionnet \\([3]\\).

Traditional statistical models often fall short in capturing the nonlinear dynamics and unstructured signals embedded in textual data. This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA family, to enhance predictive performance by integrating historical price data with financial news. We compare LLaMA 3.3 with LLaMA 3.1 and a benchmark ARIMA model, evaluating their ability to capture both time series patterns and sentiment-driven signals. Results show that LLaMA 3.3 significantly outperforms the alternatives, confirming the added value of incorporating news sentiment into the forecasting process. The findings underscore the potential of LLM-based approaches to improve market predictions by fusing structured and unstructured data, with implications for traders, analysts, and financial institutions.

Kołodziejek(Politechnika Warsaw), H. Nakashima(Tokai) and M. Wilczyński (Politechnika Wroclaw) Estimating high-dimensional concentration (inverse covariance, precision) matrices is a central problem in modern statistics. Graphical models provide a powerful framework for uncovering conditional‐independence structures. Wainwright et al. \\([1,2]\\) made seminal contributions by analyzing the graphical lasso (GLASSO) estimator, focusing on its ability to recover both the support and the sign pattern of the true precision matrix. The GLASSO employs an L1-penalty (regularizer) and is tailored to exploit sparsity. However, many statistical models exhibit richer structure, eg. affine relations among precision‐matrix entries (in particular equality constraints among them), maximal terms positions, hierarchy of coefficients, ... Colored Gaussian graphical models, introduced by Højsgaard and Lauritzen \\([3]\\), combine two complementary forms of parsimony: sparsity induced by conditional independence zeros and symmetry imposed via equality constraints on entries. Recovering richer structures requires regularizers beyond the L1 one. A powerful conceptual framework for designing such regularizers comes from the theory of atomic norms (Chandrasekaran et al. \\([4]\\)) which posits that many simple models can be expressed as a combination of a few elementary \"atoms\" from a predefined set. The corresponding atomic norm, whose unit ball is the convex hull of this atomic set, then serves as a natural regularizer. This general approach provides a unified way to convert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, leading to convex optimization solutions for recovering structured models. In this research, we focus on the subclass of atomic norms whose unit ball is a polytope. The supremum norm as penalty, can isolate a cluster of entries with the largest magnitudes. The sorted L1 norms(SLOPE) allow more sophisticated learning, interpolating between L1 and supremum norm properties and they are well-suited for recovering the patterns inherent in colored graphical models. Consequently, atomic norms as penalties provide a huge potential of recovering structured models. Despite this potential, theoretical guarantees of pattern recovery with atomic norms in the context of precision matrix estimation, remained unknown. In our research presented in this talk we fill in this gap. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Pradeep Ravikumar, Martin J. Wainwright, Garvesh Raskutti, and Bin Yu.

Gaussian Whittle–Matern fields on metric graphs Jonas Wallin (Lund university) Random fields are popular models in statistics and machine learning for spatially dependent data on Euclidian domains. However, in many applications, data is observed on non-Euclidian domains such as street networks, or river networks. In this case, it is much more difficult to construct valid random field models. In this talk, we discuss some recent approaches to modeling data in this setting, and in particular define a new class of Gaussian processes on compact metric graphs. The proposed models, the Whittle-Matérn fields, are defined via a stochastic partial differential equation on the compact metric graph and are a natural extension of Gaussian fields with Matérn covariance functions on Euclidean domains to the non-Euclidean metric graph setting. Property testing in graphical models: testing small separation numbers Piotr Zwiernik (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) In many statistical applications, the dimension is too large to handle for standard high-dimensional machine learning procedures. This is particularly true for graphical models, where the interpretation of a large graph is difficult and learning its structure is often computationally impossible either because the underlying graph is not sufficiently sparse or the number of vertices is too large. To partially address this issue, we develop a procedure to test a property of a graph underlying a graphical model that requires only a subquadratic number of correlation queries (i.e., we require that the algorithm only can access a tiny fraction of the covariance matrix). This provides a conceptually simple test to determine whether the underlying graph is a tree or, more generally, if it has a small separation number, a quantity closely related to the treewidth of the graph. The proposed method is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be applied quite generally.

Under the assumption that the drift belongs to \\(L^1_t L^1_{loc}\\) and has linear growth, we establish the existence of weak solutions for Lebesgue almost everywhere initial data. Furthermore, when the Hurst parameter \\(H\\in (0,1/2]\\) and the drift lies in \\(L^{1/(1-H)}_t L^{1/(1-H)}_{loc}\\), we give weak uniqueness.

Regularity of the density of singular SDEs driven by fractional noise and application to McKean-Vlasov equations Alexandre RICHARD (CentraleSupélec, Université Paris-Saclay) First, we will consider the SDE \\(dX_t = b(t,X_t) dt + dB_t\\), where \\(b\\) is a singular drift (e.g. a distribution) and \\(B\\) is a fractional Brownian motion. We will review some recent results on existence and uniqueness for this equation, providing criteria linking the regularity of \\(b\\) and the Hurst parameter \\(H\\) of the fractional Brownian motion. Next, we will study the time-space regularity of the conditional density of the solution in Lebesgue-Besov spaces, and also provide Gaussian bounds. Then by exploiting this regularity, we will demonstrate the existence of solutions for McKean-Vlasov equations of the form \\(dY_t = \\mu_t \\ast b(t,Y_t) + dB_t\\), where \\(\\mu_t\\) is the law of the solution \\(Y_t\\), for a drift \\(b\\) that can be more singular than in the linear case, and chosen in the full sub-critical regime of such SDEs.

Sharpness refers to the comparability of the heat kernel on the integers \\([3]\\). The implications of the characterization for unbounded geometry come with new information: heat kernel bounds are corrected by the vertex degree of the space-variables, and the corrections become small exponentially fast in time. The Faber-Krahn dimension in balls can be related to the the vertex degree growth and the doubling dimension. Bibliography \\([1]\\) M. T. Barlow. Random Walks and Heat Kernels on Graphs.

This connection can be used to prove annealed limit theorems for first passage times and maximal local times of the random walk by examining the growth of the associated branching process. I will focus on the model known as a random walk in a sparse random environment, in which the walker moves symmetrically apart from some randomly chosen sites where random drift is imposed. This model may be thought of as an interpolation between the simple symmetric random walk and a random walk in i.i.d. random environment, in which random drifts are put at all sites. We will see how the interplay between the drift and the sparsity of the environment affects the asymptotic properties of the walk.

Leveraging the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetric formalism for Langevin equations, this framework extends traditional stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to encompass systems with multiplicative noise and long-range correlations (arbitrary noises). A generalized Fokker-Planck equation is derived and solved for two stochastic processes with thresholds, enabling the estimation of Shannon entropy and entropy production rates. The results reveal the emergence of quasi-steady states characterized by a non-monotonic behavior in the entropy production rate. Path integrals for fractional Langevin equations and anomalous phenomena David Santiago Quevedo (Utrecht University) In the last decades, the fractional Langevin equation has been intensively used to study anomalous diffusion and ergodicity breaking in out-of-equilibrium systems. The interplay of fractional friction kernels and random noises leads to deviations of the MSD from the usual linear behavior and the emergence of dynamical phases marked by (weak) ergodicity breaking. Notably, these include time crystals and time glasses—nontrivial regimes manifesting periodicity and metastability. In this talk, we present a generalized path integral formalism to treat multidimensional non-Markovian Langevin equations describing processes that involve fractional operators and fractional Gaussian noises. Our results recover the conventional ones for the underdamped Langevin equation and the Klein-Kramers equations, and extend them to more general settings. A general solution scheme is also presented, together with some benchmark cases.

Sapienza University of Rome) Random resistor networks are widely used in Physics to analyze transport in disordered systems, such as mixtures of conducting and non-conducting materials, doped semiconductors, and disordered superconductors. For a broad class of random geometries large-scale conduction can be described using deterministic coefficients derived from stochastic homogenization. Within this universal description, a material behaves as a conductor or an insulator depending on the statistical properties of macroscopic crossings in the resistor network. We will describe sufficient conditions for the emergence of macroscopic conduction. As an application, we will discuss Mott variable-range hopping in doped semiconductors in the low temperature regime which amplifies the effects of disorder, giving rise to the physics Mott’s law. Time permitting, we will also provide insights into universal laws for AC conduction via random electrical circuits and into the analysis of transport through stochastic interacting particle systems in random environments - moving beyond the mean-field approximation at the basis of random resistor networks.

On estimating Fréchet means Roberto Imbuzeiro Oliveira (IMPA (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)) A Fréchet mean (or barycenter) of a distribution \\(P\\) over a metric space \\((\\mathcal{X},d)\\) is any point \\[\\mu\\in {\\rm arg}\\min_{m\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\mathbb{E}_{X\\sim P}\\,d^2(X,m).\\] This definition makes sense for any \\((\\mathcal{X},d)\\), and coincides with the expectation of \\(P\\) if \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is Euclidean space. This talk considers the problem of estimating Fréchet means from an i.i.d. sample from \\(P\\), possibly contaminated by adversarial noise. The goal is to obtain optimal or-nearly optimal high probability bounds under weak moment assumptions on \\(P\\). Two main settings are considered. The first one consists of Alexandrov spaces where geodesics are “bi-extendible” in some precise quantitative sense, which is rich enough to include the space of probability measures over \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) with the Wasserstein-\\(2\\) distance. Our main theorem for this case refines an analysis of \\([1]\\), and obtains bounds with the “right” variance parameters The second setting we consider is that of uniformly convex Banach spaces of power type \\(2\\), where our results seem to be completely new.

However, aggregating their predictions can result in uncontrolled risk due to data heterogeneity and model uncertainty. We propose a novel risk control framework that leverages knowledge transfer to calibrate and control risk across local servers. Our approach assumes that each server has a threshold parameter to bound the risk at a desired level of confidence, even when the local models are black-box. By aggregating these thresholds through a calibrated weighting scheme, our method guarantees that the overall risk remains below a target level with high probability. Model Setup Let \\(K\\) be the number of local servers. For each server \\(k \\in \\{1, \\dots, K\\}\\): \\(\\{(X^{(k)}_i, Y^{(k)}_i)\\}_{i=1}^{n_k} \\sim P_k\\) are exchangeable observations. Data is split into training and calibration sets: \\(I^{(k)}_{\\text{train}}\\) and \\(I^{(k)}_{\\text{cal}}\\). A score function \\(S(Y, X)\\) is defined. Set-valued predictor \\(\\mathcal{T}^k_\\lambda: \\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y}&#39;\\), e.g., \\[\\mathcal{T}^k_\\lambda(X) = \\{ Y : S(X, Y) \\leq \\lambda \\}.\\] Predictors are nested: \\(\\lambda_1 &lt; \\lambda_2 \\Rightarrow \\mathcal{T}^k_{\\lambda_1}(x) \\subset \\mathcal{T}^k_{\\lambda_2}(x)\\).

To estimate the value function, a Value Iteration scheme is proposed. Lastly, we verified our convergence result through an example using MATLAB simulation. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Wei Q, Chen X.

P32: Representation of a class of nonlinear SPDE driven by Lévy-space time noise Boubaker Smii (King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia) stand: S4 In this work, we discuss a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by Lévy space-time noise. A perturbative strong solution is constructed using tree expansion, while the truncated moments of the solution are expressed as sums over a specific class of graphs. Additionally, we will discuss some applications. P33: Learning optimal search strategies Maximilian Philipp Thiel (Friedrich Schiller University Jena) stand: S5 We investigate a repeated search problem in a stochastic environment. In particular, we deal with the so-called parking lot problem in continuous time. We model the arrival of free parking lots by an (unknown) inhomogeneous Poisson process. The search for a free parking lot near a desired location is repeated and optimal stopping rules, i.e. the time at which the first free parking space is taken, are to be determined based on the available observations. The analysis of the problem therefore requires results and approaches from stochastic control theory, reinforcement learning and, in this context, bandit problems. We develop an algorithm to determine optimal stopping rules under uncertainty. The algorithm achieves an asymptotically logarithmic regret rate under mild conditions on the Poisson process. Using a minimax criterion from statistical decision theory, we can show that a logarithmic rate is a lower bound for the regret in this problem, which in turn means that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. P34: Stable Thompson Sampling: Valid Inference via Variance Inflation Budhaditya Halder (Rutgers University, New Brunswick) stand: S6 We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms. P35: Estimation for functionals in Renewal models and applications Anna Kouroukli (University of Piraeus) stand: S7 We introduce a fully non-parametric methodology for estimating function-valued performance measures of renewal systems, with particular emphasis on the mean-availability curve \\(\\bar{A}(t)=t^{-1}\\!\\int_{0}^{t}A(x)\\,dx\\) of alternating working/repair cycles. The renewal equation is discretised on a uniform time grid, and the resulting convolution sums are evaluated with a single pass of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This grid-based strategy eliminates distributional assumptions, scales as \\(O(n\\log n)\\) in the time-horizon length, and remains numerically stable even on high-resolution grids or with large samples. Starting from the empirical distributions of the observed working and repair periods, we obtain the estimator \\(\\hat{\\bar{A}}_{n}\\) in closed FFT form. A refined Glivenko–Cantelli theorem in weighted càdlàg spaces guarantees strong consistency, while the Functional Delta Method yields asymptotic normality: \\(n^{1/2}\\bigl(\\hat{\\bar{A}}_{n}-\\bar{A}\\bigr)\\overset{d}{\\longrightarrow}\\mathcal{G},\\) where \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is a centred Gaussian process. Because every step of the construction is Hadamard-differentiable, bootstrap resampling supplies valid, data-driven confidence bands for \\(\\bar{A}(t)\\) across the entire timeline. The proposed toolkit combines computational speed with convergence properties for our non-parametric estimators. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Grübel, R. and Pitts, S. (1993).

P36: Neural network correction for numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations Marcin Miśkiewicz (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) stand: S8 Neural networks, known for their universal approximation capabilities, are widely used to solve ordinary and partial differential equations. In addition to directly approximating solutions, deep learning models can be incorporated into conventional numerical schemes to reduce the associated local truncation error. In this work, we explore the idea of a similar enhancement in the context of non-deterministic systems by introducing a neural network as a correction term in the Euler–Maruyama and Milstein methods for SDEs. Without assuming any prior knowledge of the exact solution, a single training run for a given equation enables the subsequent generation of more accurate trajectories. As demonstrated numerically on several test SDEs, augmenting the baseline scheme reduces the global approximation error in both the weak and strong sense. P37: Differential equations driven by exponential Besov-Orlicz signals František Hendrych (Charles University) stand: S9 The poster describes the extention of the rough path theory to cover paths from the exponential Besov-Orlicz space \\[B^\\alpha_{\\Phi_\\beta,q}\\quad\\mbox{ for }\\quad \\alpha\\in (1/3,1/2],\\,\\quad \\Phi_\\beta(x) \\sim \\mathrm{e}^{x^\\beta}-1\\quad\\mbox{with}\\quad \\beta\\in (0,\\infty), \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad q\\in (0,\\infty],\\] which is then used to treat nonlinear differential equations driven by such paths. The exponential Besov-Orlicz-type spaces, rough paths, and controlled rough paths are defined, a sewing lemma for such paths is given, and the existence and uniqueness of the solution to differential equations driven by these paths is stated. The results cover equations driven by paths of continuous local martingales with Lipschitz continuous quadratic variation (e.g. the Wiener process) or by paths of fractionally filtered Hermite processes in the \\(n\\)th Wiener chaos with Hurst parameter \\(H\\in (1/3,1/2]\\) (e.g. the fractional Brownian motion). P38: Learning payoffs while routing in skill-based queues Sanne van Kempen (Eindhoven University of Technology) stand: S10 Motivated by applications in service systems, we consider queueing systems where each customer must be handled by a server with the right skill set. We focus on optimizing the routing of customers to servers in order to maximize the total payoff of customer–server matches. In addition, customer—server dependent payoff parameters are assumed to be unknown a priori. We construct a machine learning algorithm that adaptively learns the payoff parameters while maximizing the total payoff and prove that it achieves polylogarithmic regret. Moreover, we show that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic terms by deriving a regret lower bound. The algorithm leverages the basic feasible solutions of a static linear program as the action space. The regret analysis overcomes the complex interplay between queueing and learning by analyzing the convergence of the queue length process to its stationary behavior. We also demonstrate the performance of the algorithm numerically, and have included an experiment with time-varying parameters highlighting the potential of the algorithm in non-static environments. P39: Advances in Bayesian Hidden Markov Models with Intractable Normalizing Functions Daniele Tancini (University of Perugia) stand: S11 Daniele Tancini\\(^{1}\\), Riccardo Rastelli\\(^{2}\\) and Francesco Bartolucci\\(^{1}\\) \\(^{1}\\) Department of Economics, University of Perugia, Italy \\(^{2}\\) School of Mathematics and Statistics, University College Dublin, Ireland Hidden Markov models are widely used across many research areas. However, for some of these models the latent process distribution involves an intractable normalizing constant, especially in spatial and spatio-temporal applications. These latent distributions are typically replaced with pseudo-distributions \\([1]\\), obtaining a pseudo-posterior distribution, which could affect the estimation results, especially in the presence of strong dependencies between the latent variables. Alternatively to the pseudo-posterior solution, an estimation based on the true posterior-distribution can be carried out using an exchange algorithm \\([2]\\), which eliminates the need to calculate the entire distribution of the latent variables. The original exchange algorithm requires to augment the posterior distribution with an auxiliary variable which needs a perfect simulator. In this work, an approximate exchange algorithm \\([3]\\) is considered, which does not require a perfect simulator for the auxiliary component. This is because it uses a Gibbs sampler for the auxiliary process that must have the same distribution as the intractable one. In addition, we propose a method to approximate the marginal likelihood of hidden Markov models with intractable normalizing functions. For these models a double layer of intractability is involved due the integral of the unnormalized posterior distribution over the parameters and the intractable normalizing constant. Diﬀerent methods have been proposed for estimating the marginal likelihood of these types of models; see in particular \\([4, 5]\\). These methods require extra simulations beyond the primary posterior simulation, leading to significant computational challenges. The new approach proposed is based on the reciprocal importance sampling \\([6]\\) combined with the exchange algorithm. Using the proposed method, the marginal likelihood is approximated exploiting the output of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, using only the unnormalized posterior distribution from the sampled parameter values, without requiring simulations beyond the main posterior sampling.

For convenience we refer to them as Markov additive processes, or MAPs for short. Historically used in the setting of queuing theory, MAPs have often been written about when the underlying modulating process is an ergodic Markov chain on a finite state space, cf. \\([1]\\) and \\([2]\\) not to mention the classical contributions of Prabhu \\([3]\\) and \\([4]\\). Recent works have addressed the strong law of large numbers when the underlying modulating process is a general Markov processes; cf. \\([5]\\) and \\([6]\\). We add to the latter with a different approach based on an ergodic theorem for additive functionals and on the semi-martingale structure of the additive part. This approach also allows us to deal with the setting that the modulator of the MAP is either positive or null recurrent. The methodology additionally inspires a CLT-type result.

P42: From Text to Trends: The Feasibility of LLMs in Quantitative Finance Rahul Tak (Bucharest University of Economic Studiies) stand: S14 Predicting stock movements remains a formidable challenge due to the dynamic nature of financial markets and the impact of external factors like investor sentiment,macroeconomic events, etc. Conventional time-series statistical models frequently fail to capture the intricate nonlinear dependencies and latent market signals present in unstructured data. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance predictive accuracy by integrating textual data from financial news, social media, and earnings reports. In this study, we used the Chronos and LLaMA families of LLMs to evaluate the stock price forecasts generated by combining historical price data with news sentiment. We compare the performance of LLaMA-3.3, LLaMA-3.1, Chronos, and a benchmark ARIMA model to assess their efficacy in capturing temporal patterns and textual signals. Our findings reveal that while LLaMA-3.3 effectively extracts sentiment cues, all models exhibit limitations in accurately predicting market direction. Furthermore, our analysis suggest that market sentiment influences stock returns, particularly in driving short-term returns changes. By incorporating news sentiment into LLM prompts, we achieve improved forecasting performance compared to models relying solely on numerical data. These results underscore the importance of integrating structured (time series) and unstructured (sentiment) data for robust financial modeling. Our study suggests that LLM-driven sentiment analysis holds considerable promise for traders, analysts, and financial institutions seeking enhanced market insights. Future research should explore fine-tuning LLaMA models for domain-specific financial applications and improving interpretability in investment decision-making processes.

In this talk, we review recent progress with respect to a class of reaction-diffusion stochastic particle systems on an \\(n\\)-dimensional lattice. In such a process, particles can move across sites as well as be created/annihilated according to diffusion and reaction rates. These rates will be chosen so that there are two preferred particle mass density levels \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\). In the evolution, one may understand, when the diffusion and reaction schemes are appropriately scaled, that a rough interface forms between the regions where the mass density is close to \\(a_1\\) or \\(a_2\\). Via notions in the theory of hydrodynamic limits, we discuss when the scaled limit of the particle mass density field in \\(n\\geq 2\\) is a sharp interface flow by mean-curvature. We also discuss the fluctuation field limit of the mass near the forming interface, which informs on the approach to the continuum view in a certain stationary regime in \\(n=1,2\\). Minimal surfaces in a random environment Ron Peled (University of Maryland and Tel Aviv University) A minimal surface in a random environment (MSRE) is a surface which minimizes the sum of its elastic energy and its environment potential energy, subject to prescribed boundary conditions. Apart from their intrinsic interest, such surfaces are further motivated by connections with disordered spin systems, first-passage percolation models and minimal cuts in the Z^D lattice with random capacities. We wish to study the geometry of d-dimensional minimal surfaces in a (d+n)-dimensional random environment. Specializing to a model that we term harmonic MSRE, in an “independent\" or \"Brownian” random environment, we rigorously establish bounds on the geometric and energetic fluctuations of the minimal surface, as well as a scaling relation that ties together these two types of fluctuations. In particular, we prove, for all values of n, that the surfaces are delocalized in dimensions d ≤ 4 and localized in dimensions d ≥ 5. Moreover, the surface delocalizes with power-law fluctuations when d ≤ 3 and with sub-power-law fluctuations when d = 4. Many of our results are new even for d = 1 (indeed, even for d = n = 1), corresponding to the well-studied case of (non-integrable) first-passage percolation. Based on joint works with Barbara Dembin, Dor Elboim and Daniel Hadas, with Michal Bassan and Shoni Gilboa and with Michal Bassan and Paul Dario. Bootstrap percolation and kinetically constrained models: universality results Cristina Toninelli (Ceremade, University Dauphine - PSL and CNRS) Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the study of bootstrap percolation (BP) models. In the initial configuration sites are occupied with probability p. The evolution of BP proceeds in discrete time: empty sites remain empty, while occupied sites become empty if and only if a certain model-dependent neighborhood is already empty. On Z^d there is now a fairly complete understanding of the dynamics starting from random initial conditions, along with a clear universality picture for their critical behavior. Much less is known about their non-monotone stochastic counterpart, namely kinetically constrained models (KCM). In these models each vertex is either infected or healthy and, iff it is infectable according to the BP rules, its state is resampled (independently) at rate one and becomes infected with probability p, and healthy with probability 1-p. These models, introduced and intensively studied in physics literature as toy models of the liquid/glass transition, present both challenging and fascinating mathematical problems. Indeed, the presence of constraints induce non-attractiveness, multiple invariant measures, and the breakdown of many powerful tools (such as coercive inequalities, coupling arguments, and censoring techniques) typically used to study convergence to equilibrium. In this talk, I will present a series of results that establish the full universality picture of KCM in two dimensions. We will see that, compared to those of BP, the universality classes for the stochastic dynamics are richer and the critical time scales diverge more rapidly due to the dominant role of energy barriers. The seminar is based on joint works with I.Hartarsky, L.Marêché, F.Martinelli, and R.Morris.

Researchers have been recently interested in this area of study. In the article, we have explored an epidemic model that combines SIRS and SIR, two different transmission techniques. The considered deterministic model has been perturbed stochastically at transmission rates. For the resulting stochastic model, the analysis has been done. We study the periodic solution for the stochastic system. We use the Lyapunov function and Khasminskii theory to establish that the nonautonomous periodic form of the system with white noise has a positive periodic solution.

P44: Limit Theorems for the Infinite Occupancy Scheme Valeriia Kotelnykova (University of California, Irvine; Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv) stand: S2 The infinite occupancy scheme is defined as follows. Balls are thrown independently into an infinite array of boxes numbered \\(1\\), \\(2,\\ldots\\), with a probability \\(p_k\\) of hitting the box \\(k\\). Here, \\((p_k)_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\) is a discrete probability distribution with infinitely many \\(p_k&gt;0\\). We are interested in the number of occupied boxes, denoted by \\(\\mathcal{K}_n\\), after \\(n\\) balls have been distributed. First, I will discuss the common assumptions imposed on the distribution \\((p_k)_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\). Then, I will provide an overview of the recent limit theorems for the number of occupied boxes \\(\\mathcal{K}_n\\): a functional limit theorem \\([2]\\); laws of the iterated and single logarithm \\([1]\\).

Azzaba, Skikda) stand: S3 NA P46: Modelling of natural catastrophe losses in adjacent regions Martyna Zdeb (Politechnika Wrocławska) stand: S4 Natural catastrophes may cause enormous losses in property and infrastructure, posing a huge threat not only to societies, but insurance and reinsurance companies as well. At the moment, catastrophe bonds are widely used to transfer risks related to natural catastrophes from companies to capital market investors. Pricing of a CAT bond involves modelling of the occurrence and the severity of losses caused by catastrophic events. Since CAT bonds are usually affecting multiple regions at the same time, we construct different pricing models based on various scenarios of dependence between losses in different areas. We consider cases with independent loss amounts, constant proportion between them, and arbitrary two-dimensional distributions with given correlation coefficient, and find differences between considered approaches. We illustrate considered models using data about catastrophe losses from Property Claim Services. P47: Identification of the heavy-tailed behaviour using modified Greenwood statistic - univariate and multivariate case. Katarzyna Skowronek (Politechnika Wrocławska) stand: S5 In this work, we present a methodology based on a modified Greenwood statistic for statistical testing in various scenarios for univariate and multivariate data. Classical Greenwood statistic is defined for positive random variables, while it’s modified version is defined for all real-valued random variables. One of the most important properties of the classical and modified Greenwood statistics is their stochastic monotonicity within the star-shaped ordered distribution. We utilize this property to propose statistical tests for the normal distribution for the classes of \\(\\alpha\\)-stable and Student’s t distributions, and for infinite variance in the classes of Pareto and Student’s t distributions. Moreover, a relatively simple form of the modified Greenwood statistic allows a straightforward extension to the multivariate case. We prove that the stochastic monotonicity of the modified Greenwood statistic holds for multivariate star-shaped ordered distributions. Therefore, we expand the proposed tests from the univariate to the multivariate case. In this work, we limit our analysis to the two- and three-dimensional distributions. To validate the efficiency of the proposed methods, we demonstrate the results of the proposed methods via Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we compare introduced tests with the methods known in the literature. Bibliography \\([1]\\) K. Skowronek, M. Arendarczyk, R. Zimroz, A.

We focus on Markov chains with the direct step property, which is satisfied by a wide range of typically considered kernels. While intrinsic ultracontractivity is a very strong tool in studying the analytical and ergodic properties of these structures, in our setting it requires a sufficiently fast growth of the potential, severely restricting its applicability. In our joint work with Wojciech Cygan, René Schilling and Kamil Kaleta \\([1,2]\\), we use the concept of progressive intrinsic ultracontractivity (pIUC), originally introduced by Kaleta and Schilling in the continuous case, to prove that Feynman–Kac semigroups satisfying our assumptions, as well as their related intrinsic semigroups, enjoy a progressive analogue of uniform (quasi-)ergodicity.

The existence part is due to Hölder stability estimates of the associated Euler-Maruyama scheme. The uniqueness part is due to that of the associated Fokker-Planck equation. We also obtain convergence rate in weighted \\(L^1\\) norm for the Euler-Maruyama scheme. P50: Preventing large-scale avalanches in the 2D Abelian sandpile model using strategic interventions Maike de Jongh (University of Twente) stand: S8 The Abelian sandpile model (ASM) is a fundamental example of a dynamical system exhibiting self-organized criticality, offering key insights into the emergence of extreme events. Avalanche dynamics in the ASM have inspired models of earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, and cascading failures in networks. In our work, we explore how strategic interventions can reduce the expected size of avalanches. First, we present a method to compute the expected size of an avalanche generated by a cluster of critical vertices, based on the decomposition of avalanches into a sequence of waves proposed by Ivashkevich et al. \\([1]\\). Second, we analyze the effect of removing sand grains from square-shaped clusters of critical vertices. For such clusters, we provide explicit results on the impact of targeted sand grain removals and identify the set of vertices from which removing sand grains most effectively reduces the expected avalanche size.

P51: Stochastic Dynamic Server Scheduling with Interruptible Set-up Times in a Network Dongnuan Tian (Lancaster University) stand: S9 We consider a stochastic, dynamic scheduling problem in which a single server operates over a network to process jobs of different types arriving at designated demand points according to independent Poisson processes. Jobs accumulate waiting costs while queued at their respective locations, and the server dynamically travels around the network to process them. The travel time between nodes represents the sequence-dependent, interruptible set-up time required to switch between job types. This network-based formulation allows us to capture complex relationships in switching efforts between different tasks. We model the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective of minimizing the long-run average holding cost. We prove the existence of a stationary policy that ensures system stability under a workload condition. Due to the intractability of exact solutions in large state spaces, we propose a class of index-based heuristic policies with desirable structural properties. We also discuss how these heuristics can be modified to scale effectively with problem size and demonstrate their performance through extensive numerical experiments against suitable benchmarks. P52: Windings of planar Stochastic Processes Stavros Vakeroudis (Athens University of Economics and Business) stand: S10 Two-dimensional (planar) processes attract the interest of several researchers. This happens both because of their richness from a theoretical point of view and because their study turns out to be very fruitful in terms of applications (e.g. in Finance \\([9]\\), in Biology \\([8]\\) etc.). Here, we focus on the fine study of trajectories of planar processes, and in particular on their windings. We survey several results concerning windings of two-dimensional processes, including planar Brownian motion (BM), complex-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and planar stable processes (see e.g. \\([5,6]\\). We also present Spitzer’s asymptotic Theorem for each case. Our starting point is the skew-product representation. Then, we introduce Bougerol’s celebrated identity in law \\([7]\\) which is very useful for the study of the windings of planar BM and of complex-valued OU processes, stating that, for \\(u&gt;0\\) fixed, \\[\\sinh(\\beta_{u}) \\stackrel{(law)}{=} \\hat{\\beta}_{A_{u}(\\beta)=\\int^{u}_{0}ds\\exp(2\\beta_{s})} \\ ,\\] where \\((\\beta_{t},t\\geq0)\\) and \\((\\hat{\\beta_{t}},t\\geq0)\\) are two independent linear Brownian motions, and the second one is also independent from \\(A_{u}(\\beta)\\). However, this method cannot be applied for the case of planar stable processes \\([1]\\). So, we tackle this problem firstly by using new methods invoking the continuity of the composition function \\([3]\\) and secondly by applying new techniques from the theory of self-similar Markov processes \\([4]\\) having as a starting point the so-called Riesz–Bogdan–Żak transform introduced in \\([2]\\) which gives the law of the stable process when passed through the spatial Kelvin transform and an additional time change. This approach allows to study similarly one-dimensional and (possibly) higher-dimensional windings. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Jean Bertoin and Wendelin Werner, Stable windings. Ann.

However, simulating their transient dynamics is computationally demanding due to the high-dimensional, non-linear nature of these systems. This challenge is particularly acute when multiple interacting subsystems are involved, as the matrix dimension of the Lindblad master equation then expands exponentially. We address this by employing stochastic methods that utilize only a few stochastic variables per mode to accurately capture key observables in the transient dynamics. P56: Littlewood–Paley estimates for pure-jump Dirichlet forms Michał Gutowski (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) stand: S14 Littlewood–Paley square functions were first introduced by Littlewood and Paley in \\([1]\\). They found application in many research areas, for instance, in harmonic analysis, in the study of \\(L^p\\)-spaces, Fourier multipliers, and partial differential equations. We used a recently proved generalized Hardy–Stein identity to extend previous Littlewood–Paley estimates to pure-jump Dirichlet forms. Our results generalize earlier estimates obtained for pure-jump Lévy processes on Euclidean space \\([2]\\). Moreover, we relax some of the assumptions used in previous papers \\([2, 3]\\). To overcome the difficulty that Itô’s formula is not applicable in our setting, we employed the theory of Revuz correspondence and additive functionals. Meanwhile, we also present some counterexamples demonstrating that certain inequalities do not hold in the generality considered in our work. Bibliography \\([1]\\) John E. Littlewood, Raymond E. A.

We demonstrate that this object is consistent and asymptotically normal by establishing a quantitative propagation of chaos for Malliavin derivatives, which holds for any \\(H \\in (0,1)\\). Leveraging a connection between the divergence integral and the Young integral, we construct computable estimators of the drift parameter. These estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Finally, a numerical study highlights the strong performance of the proposed estimators. This is based on a joint work with I. Nourdin and R. Shevchenko. Adaptive minimax estimation for discretely observed Lévy processes Céline Duval (Sorbonne Université - LPSM) We study the nonparametric estimation of the density \\(f_\\Delta\\) of an increment of a Lévy process based on observations with a sampling rate \\(\\Delta\\). The class of Lévy processes considered is broad, including both processes with a Gaussian component and pure jump processes. A key focus is on processes where \\(f_\\Delta\\) is smooth for all \\(\\Delta\\). We use a spectral estimator of \\(f_\\Delta\\) and derive both upper and lower bounds, showing that the estimator is minimax optimal in both low- and high-frequency regimes. In low-frequency settings, we recover parametric convergence rates, while in high-frequency settings, we identify two regimes based on whether the Gaussian or jump components dominate. The rates of convergence are closely tied to the jump activity, with continuity between the Gaussian case and more general jump processes. This is based on a joint work with T. Jalal and E. Mariucci. Estimation for SPDEs from noisy observations Markus Reiß (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin) We consider stochastic evolution equations of the form \\(dX(t)=A_\\theta X(t)dt+BdW_t\\) with a generator \\(A_\\theta\\) on a Hilbert space, involving an unknown real or functional parameter \\(\\theta\\). We consider observations \\(dY(t)=X(t)dt+\\varepsilon dV_t\\), \\(t\\in[0,T]\\), in space-time white noise \\(dV\\) and ask about optimal estimation of \\(\\theta\\). Minimax lower bounds reveal a rich picture, which we shall describe in detail for second-order elliptic operators \\(A_\\theta=\\nabla\\cdot(\\theta_2\\nabla+\\theta_1)+\\theta_0\\). Optimal rates depend on the order of the coefficient \\(\\theta_i\\), the dimension and the asymptotics taken. An even richer structure appears for nonparametric estimation. The lower bound proofs rely on Hellinger bounds for cylindrical Gaussian measures and functional calculus for non-commuting, unbounded normal operators. A rate-optimal parametric estimator is obtained by a subtle preaveraging approach. Finally, a nonparametric diffusivity estimator and several open problems are presented.

The Proportional Scaling Limit of Neural Networks Mufan Li (University of Waterloo) Recent advances in deep learning performance have all relied on scaling up the number of parameters within neural networks, consequently making asymptotic scaling limits a compelling approach to theoretical analysis. In this talk, we explore the proportional infinite-depth-and-width limit, where the role of depth can be adequately studied, and the limit remains a great model of finite size networks. At initialization, we characterize the limiting distribution of the network via a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the feature covariance matrix. Furthermore, in the linear network setting, we can also characterize the spectrum of the covariance matrix in the large data limit via a geometric variant of Dyson Brownian motions.

We show the usual logarithmic mixing is replaced by a power law whose exponent is the tail index. While some generic results and bounds hold for arbitrary time-change distributions, the strongest results with matching upper and lower bounds appear when the time-change is Mittag-Leffler with index less than 1. In this case the semi-Markov processes are driven by a single fractional Poisson process. One of the interesting applications (and some of the open questions) are the mixing times and relaxation times to equilibrium of fractional queueing systems.

Quasi-continuity method for mean-field systems : fluctuations and large deviations Louis-Pierre Chaintron (École Normale Supérieure de Paris (ENS)) Interacting particle systems have numerous applications in statistical physics, biological modeling, optimization algorithms, and filtering, among others. For systems exhibiting a mean-field structure, the scaling limit is commonly referred to as the \"propagation of chaos,\" a concept introduced in the foundational works of Boltzmann. For such systems with regular coefficients, I will present a particularly simple method for computing the limit. This method, originating from Tanaka (1984), offers an intuitive way to represent high-dimensional systems by drawing an analogy to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), focusing on characteristic curves rather than the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). In the case of systems with additive noise, the computation of fluctuations and large deviations follows straightforwardly. By using an appropriate discretization, I will also demonstrate how these results can be extended to systems with multiplicative noise and more general types of interactions. Control of correlation functions in mean-field systems and consequences Armand BERNOU (Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1) This talk will focus on mean-field particle systems with small, non-singular interactions and some noise. For such systems, ergodic properties of the mean-field limit PDE typically yield a uniform-in-time propagation of chaos property, which provides a first-order description of the system as \\(N\\) goes to infinity. I will discuss recent results allowing to derive higher-order description of the system through a uniform-in-time control of many-body correlation functions. Some consequences on the phenomena of creation of chaos and Gibbs relaxation will also be mentioned. Based on joint works with Mitia Duerinckx and Matthieu Ménard.

We impose that when the resulting surplus becomes negative the company has to decide whether to inject capital to get to a positive surplus level in order for the company to survive or to let ruin occur. The objective is to find the combined dividends and capital injections strategy that maximises the expected paid out dividends minus cost of injected capital, discounted at a constant rate, until ruin. We consider the setting where the cost of capital is level-dependent in the sense that it is higher when the surplus is below \\(0\\) than when it is above \\(0\\). We investigate optimality of a \\(3\\)-parameter strategy with parameters \\(-r &lt; 0 &lt; c &lt; b\\) where dividends are paid out to keep the surplus below \\(b\\), capital injections are made in order to keep the surplus above \\(c\\) unless capital drops below the level \\(-r\\) in which case the company decides to let ruin occur.

Valuation of multi-region CoCoCat bonds Krzysztof Burnecki (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) We introduce a novel, multidimensional insurance-linked instrument: a contingent convertible bond (CoCoCat bond) whose conversion trigger is activated by predefined natural catastrophes across multiple geographical regions. We develop such a model, explicitly accounting for the complex dependencies between regional catastrophe losses. Specifically, we explore scenarios ranging from complete independence to proportional loss dependencies, both with fixed and random loss amounts. Utilizing change-of-measure techniques, we derive risk-neutral pricing formulas tailored to these varied dependence structures. By fitting our model to real-world natural catastrophe data from Property Claim Services, we demonstrate the significant impact of inter-regional dependencies on the CoCoCat bond’s pricing, highlighting the importance of multidimensional risk assessment for this innovative financial instrument. Expectiles in probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices with risk management implications Joanna Janczura (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) We propose a new method for probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices. It is based on averaging point forecasts from different models combined with expectile regression. We show that deriving the predicted distribution in terms of expectiles, might be in some cases advantageous to the commonly used quantiles. Using expectile predictions as a future risk measure we propose a short-term diversification strategy for an electricity trader. The proposed methods are applied to the day-ahead electricity prices from the German market. The obtained results show that implementation of dynamic strategies based on expectiles improves the outcomes in terms of risk as well as profit.

Percolation in lattice k-neighbor graphs András Tóbiás (Budapest University of Technology and Economics; Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics) We define a random graph obtained via connecting each point of \\(\\mathbb Z^d\\) independently to a fixed number \\(1 \\leq k \\leq 2d\\) of its nearest neighbors via a directed edge. We call this graph the directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph. Two natural associated undirected graphs are the undirected and the bidirectional \\(k\\)-neighbor graph, where we connect two vertices by an undirected edge whenever there is a directed edge in the directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph between them in at least one, respectively precisely two, directions. In these graphs we study the question of percolation, i.e., the existence of an infinite self-avoiding path. Using different kinds of proof techniques for different classes of cases, we show that for \\(k=1\\) even the undirected \\(k\\)-neighbor graph never percolates, but the directed one percolates whenever \\(k \\geq d+1\\). Our main result is the following. Theorem. The directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph percolates when \\(k \\geq 3\\) and \\(d \\geq 5\\), or \\(k=d=4\\). The proof of this result is based on a technique developed by Cox and Durrett \\([2]\\) (1983) for verifying the existence of an infinite oriented path in higher-dimensional oriented percolation. We also show that the undirected 2-neighbor graph percolates for \\(d=2\\), the undirected 3-neighbor graph percolates for \\(d=3\\), and we provide some positive and negative percolation results regarding the bidirectional graph as well. A heuristic argument for high dimensions indicates that this class of models is a natural discrete analogue of the -nearest-neighbor graphs studied in continuum percolation, and our results support this interpretation. Percolation in the directed graph for \\(k=d=2\\) has recently been proven by Coupier, Henry, Jahnel and Köppl \\([1]\\), which will be explained in another talk of our contributed session by Jonas Köppl.

We prove that the \\(2\\)-neighbor graph percolates on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\), i.e., that the origin is connected to infinity with positive probability. The proof rests on duality, an exploration algorithm, a comparison to i.i.d. bond percolation under constraints as well as enhancement arguments.

Under mild assumptions, in the (most subtle) setting in which the mean drift in the interior is zero, we classify recurrence and transience and provide power-law bounds on tails of passage times; the classification depends on the interior covariance matrix, the (finitely many) drifts near the boundaries, and stationary distributions derived from two one-dimensional Markov chains associated to each of the two boundaries. As an application, we consider reflected random walks related to multidimensional variants of the Lindley process, for which no previous quantitative results on passage-times appear to be known.

In this talk, I will present one such example from the field of systems biology. We consider a stochastic model of the Michaelis-Menten (MM) enzyme kinetic reactions in terms of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) driven by Poisson Random Measures (PRMs). It has been argued that among various Quasi-Steady State Approximations (QSSAs) for the deterministic model of such chemical reactions, the total QSSA (tQSSA) is the most accurate approximation, and it is valid for a wider range of parameter values than the standard QSSA (sQSSA). While the sQSSA for this model has been rigorously derived from a probabilistic perspective at least as early as 2006 in Ball et al. (2006), a rigorous study of the tQSSA for the stochastic model appears missing.

Self-intersection local times of Volterra Gaussian processes in stochastic flows Olga Iziumtseva (University of Nottingham) Self-intersection local times of a random process are random variables that measure how much time the process spends in small neighborhoods of its self-intersection points. Being the geometric characteristics of nonsmooth random processes \\([1]\\), it found applications in studying of polymer models. Weighted self-intersection local times for a random process \\(x(t),\\ t\\in[0,1]\\) are formally defined as \\[T_k(\\rho)=\\int_{\\Delta_k}\\rho(x(t_1))\\prod^{k-1}_{i=1}\\delta_0(x(t_{i+1})-x(t_i))dt_1\\ldots dt_k,\\] where \\(\\Delta_k=\\{0\\leqslant t_1\\leqslant\\ldots \\leqslant t_k\\leqslant 1\\}\\), \\(\\rho\\) is a weight function and \\(\\delta_0\\) is the Dirac delta function at zero.

Instead of analyzing second-order summary statistics like the Ripley K-function, one can estimate Bartlett’s spectral measure, also known in physics as the structure factor \\(S\\), which is the Fourier transform of the pair correlation function. Several estimators of \\(S\\) have been introduced \\([1, 2, 3]\\). However, without a reference minimax rate of convergence, it remains unclear whether better estimators could be constructed. We address this gap by proving the following minimax result: for estimating a structure factor of Hölder regularity \\(\\beta\\), the worst-case error of any estimator is at least the expected number of observed points raised to the power \\(-\\beta/(2\\beta + d)\\). We then construct multi-taper estimators that achieve this optimal rate and further show that they exhibit exponential concentration. These estimators are oracle in the sense that they depend on unknown parameters related to the smoothness of \\(S\\). To obtain a practical estimator, we propose a cross-validation method based on random thinning and decorrelation between distinct frequencies. Bibliography \\([1]\\) D. Hawat, G. Gautier, R.

Estimating the hyperuniformity exponent of point processes Bartlomiej Blaszczyszyn (Inria/ENS) Hyperuniformity characterizes random spatial structures whose large-scale variance grows more slowly than that of Poisson processes. First introduced in statistical physics by Torquato and Stillinger \\([1]\\), hyperuniform systems have attracted considerable attention due to their intermediate nature between perfect crystals, liquids, and glasses, and appears in a wide range of applications, from DNA organization and immune system dynamics to photoreceptor arrangements, urban planning, and cosmology. Detecting and quantifying hyperuniformity is essential across these diverse fields. Yet, statistical testing for hyperuniformity has only recently begun to develop. In joint work \\([2]\\), we address the problem of estimating the “strength” of hyperuniformity—formally, the exponent governing the decay of the spectral density near zero frequency—in a class of stationary point processes in Euclidean space. The key mathematical idea is that the variance of linear statistics, defined using smooth, rapidly decaying test functions, grows in a way that explicitly reflects this exponent. Using a multivariate central limit theorem for a family of such statistics, constructed from orthogonal functions at multiple scales (e.g., wavelets), we derive an asymptotically consistent estimator of the strength of hyperuniformity. This estimator can be computed from a single realization of the point process and comes with explicit confidence intervals. We validate this approach through simulations of various point process models and demonstrate its applicability on real data. image image We estimated the hyperuniformity exponent \\(\\alpha\\) for the Ginibre point process in two dimensions, using 75 Hermitian wavelets (\\(f_i\\)).

Conformal Novelty Detection for Replicate Point Patterns Christophe Biscio (University of Aalborg) Monte Carlo tests are widely used for computing valid p-values without requiring known distributions of test statistics. When performing multiple Monte Carlo tests, it is essential to maintain control of the type I error. Some techniques for multiplicity control pose requirements on the joint distribution of the p-values, for instance independence, which can be computationally intensive to achieve using naïve multiple Monte Carlo testing. We highlight in this work that multiple Monte Carlo testing is an instance of conformal novelty detection. Leveraging this insight enables a more efficient multiple Monte Carlo testing procedure, avoiding excessive simulations while still ensuring exact control over the false discovery rate or the family-wise error rate. We call this approach conformal multiple Monte Carlo testing. The performance is investigated in the context of global envelope tests for point pattern data through a simulation study and an application to a sweat gland data set. Results reveal that with a fixed number of simulations under the null hypothesis, our proposed method yields substantial improvements in power of the testing procedure as compared to the naïve multiple Monte Carlo testing procedure.

By NLBVPs, we refer to problems involving the heat equation in the domain with non-local operators at the boundary, such as Marchaud-type derivatives. In this case, Brownian motion tends to escape from the boundary via jumps, with each jump corresponding to the last jump of the subordinator associated with the non-local operator. In contrast, when Brownian motion is subject to Poissonian resetting, it is reset to the origin at exponentially distributed random times, leading to a concentration near the boundary. We show that these two dynamics are related when viewed through time reversal. Bibliography \\([1]\\) F.

Time-Changed spherical Brownian motions with drift and their anomalous behaviour Giacomo Ascione (Scuola Superiore Meridionale) Anomalous diffusions in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) are characterized by a nonlinear relation between the mean-square displacement of the diffusing particles and the time-variable. It is clear, however, that this definition cannot be applied to diffusing particles in a compact Riemannian manifold. Even for the Brownian motion, while the linear character of the mean-square displacement is preserved for small times, the geometric properties of the considered domain clearly imposes an upper bound. As a consequence, one cannot recognize anomalous diffusions from standard ones by the observation of the asymptotic behaviour of the mean-square displacement. Nevertheless, even in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\), one can recognize anomalous diffusions that exhibit a linear behaviour for small times, while deviating from this as time increases: hence, even the small-time asymptotic of the mean-square displacement could be not sufficient. In this talk, we introduce a prototype of anomalous diffusion on the sphere. Precisely, we will consider a spherical Brownian motion (possibly with a special drift described by a suitable vector field) time-changed by means of an independent inverse subordinator. These models were first considered (without drift) in \\([1,2,3]\\), while the drifted model has been described in \\([4]\\). We first study the inter-connection between such processes and some time-nonlocal Kolmogorov equations on the sphere. This is done by providing an explicit representation, in terms of spherical harmonics, of strong solutions of such equations when the initial data belongs to \\(H^s(\\mathbb{S}^2)\\) for some \\(s&gt;1\\), where \\(\\{H^s(\\mathbb{S}^2)\\}_{s \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\) is the Sobolev scale induced by the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere. Thanks to this representation, we are able to show that such models still exhibit the same stationary/limit measure as the spherical Brownian motion (i.e., the uniform distribution on the sphere), but they converge to such a state in a non-exponential way. The latter phenomenon is called anomalous relaxation: we propose this characteristic to actually recognize anomalous diffusive behaviours on compact manifolds.

Anomalous Random Flights and Time-Changed Random Evolutions Francesco Iafrate (University of Hamburg) Random flights represent finite velocity random motions changing direction at any Poissonian time. We present an extension of such models to time-fractional processes arising from a non-local generalization of the kinetic equations. The probabilistic interpretation of the solutions of the time-fractional equations leads to a time-changed version of the original transport processes. The obtained results provide a clear picture of the role played by the time-fractional derivatives in this kind of random motions. The anomalous behavior of these random scattering models is useful to describe several complex systems arising in statistical physics and biology. In the case of the one-dimensional random flight, called telegraph process, we study the time-fractional version of the classical telegraph equation. Furthermore, by exploiting the Kac’s approach we give a suitable stochastic interpretation of the solution of the fractional telegraph equation. We further pursue an extension of our framework to random evolutions, which describe Markovian (or semi‑Markovian) systems undergoing stochastic regime switches. The aforementioned telegraph process serves as a prototypical example of such dynamics. We proceed to construct their time‑changed counterparts and tackle the associated non‑local evolution equations in a general abstract setting. Bibliography \\([1]\\) L. Angelani, A. De Gregorio, R.

I will define a new non-commutative independence called cyclic-conditional freeness, unifying three independences: infinitesimal freeness, cyclic-monotone independence (Collins, Hasebe, Sakuma), and cyclic-Boolean independence (Arizmendi, Hasebe, Lehner). Fluctuations in the Vortex model can be computed with the help of this new independence. This is a joint work with O. Arizmendi, G.

Khintchine inequality for mixtures of free and independent semicircles Raghavendra Tripathi (NYU Abu Dhabi) The classical Khintchine’s inequality provides a fundamental comparison between the \\(L_p\\) and \\(L_2\\) norms of sums of independent Rademacher variables. Over the decades, Khintchine-type inequalities have been extended in multiple directions. A profound and structurally rich generalization of Khintchine’s inequality arises in the non-commutative setting, where the classical scalar-valued theory is extended to the operator algebra setting. In this setting, one considers sums of the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^L a_i\\otimes s_i\\) where the \\(a_i\\)’s are bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space and \\(s_i\\)’s are free semicircle random variables and goal is to estimates the corresponding \\(p\\)-Schatten norm. More generally, one can take \\(s_i\\) to be \\(G\\)-independent collection of semicircles for some finite graph \\(G\\). We prove a sharp Khintchine-type estimate for (scalar) linear combinations of \\(G\\)-independent semicircles. Theorem.\\([\\)Scalar Khintchine inequality for mixtures\\(]\\) Let \\(G\\) be a graph on \\([L]\\) and let \\((s_{i})_{i=1}^{L}\\) be a collection of \\(G\\)-independent semicircles.

This strengthens a recent result by Collins and Miyagawa. Multi-Algebra Independences Arising in Bi-Free Probability Daniel Pepper (York University) In non-commutative probability, there are five main types of independence between algebras, each arising from actions of operators on corresponding product spaces. Voiculescu noticed that by studying both left and right actions on the free product simultaneously, and thus forming the notion of bi-free independence for pairs of algebras, one could study both classical (tensor) and free independence from this one viewpoint. Later it was found that in fact, all five types of independence could be studied through bi-free probability. The advent of bi-free independence spawned other notions of multi-algebra independences. Among these are Liu’s notions of free-Boolean independence for pairs of algebras, and free-free-Boolean independence for triples of algebras. The question naturally arose whether these too could be studied through bi-free probability. This talk, in an attempt to answer affirmatively to the aforementioned question, will sketch how free-free-Boolean independent operators can be embedded into, and therefore studied through bi-free probability.

Super-diffusive asymptotic behaviour of an interface kinetic model Lorenzo Marino (Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa) We study the scaling limit of solutions to a linearised Boltzmann phonon equation in one spatial dimension, subject to a random mechanism of transmission, reflection or absorption at an interface. Assuming a fast enough degeneracy of the scattering kernel and a slow decay for the probability of absorption at low frequencies, we show that the solutions to the interface model exhibit a super-diffusive behaviour in the long time limit, with the scaling parameter depending only on the interplay between the decay velocities of the scattering kernel and the drift. We also characterise such a limit as the unique weak solution to a non-local in space evolution equation, subject to boundary conditions at the interface. Our proof relies on the probabilistic formulation of the above problem, establishing a new invariance principle for the associated stochastic processes.

It describes the genealogies of the \\(\\Xi\\)-Fleming-Viot process, which is the large population size limit of a class of spatial Cannings models in which individuals follow independent Brownian motions. The Brownian spatial \\(\\Xi\\)-coalescent can also be axiomatically characterised by a spatial notion of sampling consistency among a certain class of Markov coalescent processes, similarly to how the well-known \\(\\Xi\\)-coalescent can be characterised through sampling consistency within the set of all non-spatial coalescents. An interesting consequence of this characterisation is that all spatial population models in which individuals follow independent Brownian motions have non-Markovian genealogies if the branching mechanism depends non-trivially on the spatial distribution, for example through local regulation.

It has long been proposed \\([1, 2]\\), as well as observed in simulations, that approximation schemes based on samples from the stochastic convolution, rather than from increments of the underlying Wiener processes, should achieve significantly higher convergence rates with respect to the temporal timestep. We prove that for a large class of nonlinearities, with possibly superlinear growth, a temporal rate of (almost) 1 can be achieved, a major improvement on the rate 1/4 that is known to be optimal for schemes based on Wiener increments.

Strong regularization of differential equations with integrable drifts by fractional noise Khoa Le (University of Leeds) We consider stochastic differential equations with integrable time-dependent drift driven by additive fractional Brownian noise whose Hurst parameter is less than 1/2. Under some subcriticality conditions, it is shown that such equation has a unique pathwise solution. Furthermore, stability with respect to all parameters is established. Our strong uniqueness result can be considered as an extension of that from Krylov and Röckner (2005) for Brownian motion, it also improves upon previous results of Nualart and Ouknine (2003) for dimension one. Our methods are built upon Lyons’ rough path theory and the stochastic sewing lemma, complemented by the quantitative John–Nirenberg inequality for stochastic processes of vanishing mean oscillation. Joint work with Oleg Butskovsky and Toyomu Matsuda. New algebraic structures in rough analysis and their applications Carlo Bellingeri (Université de Lorraine) Rough analysis has deeply changed the study of differential equations driven by highly irregular signals, such as sample paths of stochastic processes. At the heart of this theory lies a rich algebraic framework that encodes the nonlinear interactions of the driving signals and enables robust solution theories for SDEs and SPDEs. In recent years, new algebraic structures have emerged as powerful tools for describing general compositions of these solutions with nonlinear functions. In this talk, I will provide an overview of these emerging structures, explain how they naturally arise in the study of singular stochastic dynamics, and illustrate their applications in the contexts of branched rough paths and the generalized KPZ equation, as developed in articles \\([1,2]\\).

The talk is based on the joint work with Jean-Philippe Anker. Collisions in one-dimensional particle systems Nicole Hufnagel (Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf) In this joint work we consider a general one-dimensional particle system. These processes are mainly characterized by multiplicity parameters controlling the strength of the particles’ interaction. It is well-known that collisions between particles never take place when all of these multiplicities are large, but occur almost surely otherwise.     It was recently shown by the authors that the collision times in the special case of multivariate Bessel processes of rational type is a piecewise-linear function of the minimum of its multiplicities, but is independent of the dimension of the process’s domain. This implies that the Hausdorff dimension does not depend on the particle number.     In this talk, we present an approach to extend this result to a general particle system.

Restricting ourselves to the case where \\(m \\ge 2\\), we study the number \\(X(n)\\) of vertices that can be reached from the last added vertex \\(n\\) via a directed path. We show that after suitable rescaling, \\(X(n)\\) converges in distribution as \\(n \\to\\infty\\), and identify the limiting distribution. I will discuss this result and some proof ideas, which are based on joint work with Svante Janson. Condensation and persistent hubs in generalised preferential attachment trees Tejas Iyer (WIAS Berlin) Consider a model of trees evolving in discrete time, where nodes arrive one at a time, and connect to an existing node with probability proportional to a function of its degree. We present natural sufficient conditions for a persistent hub to emerge - that is for a single node to have the maximal degree for all but finitely many time-steps. We also present ongoing work regarding condensation in this model, where a positive proportion of the mass of edges in the tree is lost to nodes of ‘large’ degree. Persistence of hubs in preferential attachment trees with vertex death. Bas Lodewijks (University of Augsburg) We study a random tree model known as the Preferential Attachment tree with Vertex Death. Here, one can both add vertices to the tree as well as kill vertices. This model mimics the non-monotone growth of real-world networks, absent in classical preferential attachment models. One initialises the tree with a single root vertex labelled \\(1\\). At every step \\(n\\), either a new vertex labelled \\(n+1\\) is added to the tree and connected to an already present alive vertex selected preferentially according to a function \\(b\\), or an already present vertex is selected preferentially according to a function \\(d\\) and killed. Killed vertices can make no new connections. We are interested in the behaviour of the richest alive vertex \\(I_n\\) (with the largest degree) and the oldest alive vertex \\(O_n\\) (with the smallest label). When \\(I_n\\) converges almost surely, we say that a persistent hub exists. When \\(I_n\\) does not converge but \\(\\frac{I_n}{O_n}\\) is tight, we say that persistence occurs, and when \\(\\frac{I_n}{O_n}\\) diverges to infinity we say lack of persistence occurs. We uncover three distinct regimes in which behaviour is different: \\((1)\\) The infinite lifetime regime, where we provide conditions under which a persistent hub exists almost surely. \\((2)\\) The rich are old regime, in which \\(O_n\\) does not converge and where we provide conditions under which either persistence or lack of persistence occurs. \\((3)\\) The rich die young regime, in which \\(O_n\\) does not converge and where lack of persistence always occurs. We shall discuss how the three regimes can be identified and what drives the behaviour observed in each regime. Partly joint work with Markus Heydenreich.

They can be seen as a superposition of sine and cosine waves with random amplitudes. This representation allows us to analyze the dependency between their frequencies. In this context, spectral density and spectral coherence serve as frequency domain analogs of covariance and correlation, respectively. In our research, we focus on harmonizable processes whose spectral measure is concentrated on a union of lines, potentially with non-unit slopes. This class of processes is a generalization of almost periodically correlated processes. It has practical applications in communication, particularly in the location of moving sources such as aircrafts, rockets, or hostile jamming emitters that transmit signals. First, we address the spectral density estimation problem. We propose a periodogram frequency-smoothed along the support line as its estimator. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the rescaled estimator. Consequently, we obtain the asymptotic distribution of the rescaled spectral coherence estimator. In addition, we introduce a subsampling technique designed specifically for the class of processes considered. We establish its consistency and construct subsampling-based confidence intervals for the spectral characteristics of harmonizable processes. To illustrate the theoretical results, we present a simulation study for models commonly used in acoustics and communication. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Dudek, A. E. and Majewski, B.

The proposed model consists of a superposition of cosines with a nonstationary phase shift process and a stationary amplitude process. The asymptotic properties of the first- and second-order moments of the considered process are investigated. Estimators of the asymptotic mean and autocovariance functions are introduced. The performance of the autocovariance function estimator is examined in a simulation study. Finally, the model is applied to a real biomedical dataset. Deep learning-based estimation of time-dependent parameters in the AR(1) model Agnieszka Kopeć (AGH University of Krakow) An autoregressive model of order 1 (AR(1)) is a simple yet widely used Markov process across various domains. In this talk, we consider the AR(1) model with time-varying parameters, which allows for greater flexibility in modeling real-world phenomena such as price dynamics, climate variability, financial market volatility, demand forecasting, and population dynamics. We propose a novel deep learning-based method for estimating the time-dependent parameters of the model by reformulating the problem as an optimization task. Our approach is grounded in the maximum likelihood framework, from which we derive an appropriate loss function for training the neural network. We validate our method through numerical experiments and, finally, demonstrate its practical relevance by applying it to a real-world energy price dataset.

Statistical inference for semi-linear SPDEs using spatial information Sascha Gaudlitz (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin) We consider the Bayesian non-parametric estimation of the reaction term in a semi-linear parabolic SPDE. Posterior contraction rates are proven by making use of the spatial ergodicity of the SPDE while the time horizon is fixed. We additionally prove a non-parametric Bernstein- von Mises Theorem for the posterior distribution. The analysis of the posterior requires new concentration results for spatial averages of transformation of the SPDE, which are based the combination of the Clark-Ocone formula with bounds on the marginal densities. Inference for the nonlinear stochastic heat equation Ciprian Tudor (University of Lille) We consider the nonlinear stochastic heat equation with fractional Laplacian, driven by the Gaussian space-time white noise and we analyse the asymptotic behavior of the quadratic and higher order variations of its mild solution. The idea is to approximate the increments of the solution to the nonlinear heat equation with those of the solution to the linear heat equation (which is related to the fractional Brownian motion). Based on these variations, we construct estimators for several parameters that may appear in such a model: the drift and diffusion parameters or the parameter associated with the order of the fractional Laplacian.

We will study the explosive behavior of its solution following a probabilistic approach. First, we will prove a stochastic representation for the solution in terms of a spatial branching process, which in some sense extends the classical branching Brownian motion to the fractional setting.

Every particle jumps with a rate depending on its position. When this happens, all the other particles of the system receive a same random kick distributed according to a heavy tailed random variable belonging to the domain of attraction of an \\(\\alpha\\)-stable law and scaled by \\(N^{-1/\\alpha}\\), \\(\\alpha \\in (0,2)\\setminus \\{1\\}\\). We call these jumps collateral jumps. Moreover, in case \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\), the jumping particle itself undergoes a macroscopic, main jump. Similar systems are employed to model families of interacting neurons and, in that context, main and collateral jumps represent respectively the hyperpolarization of a neuron after a spike and the synaptic inputs received by post-synaptic neurons from pre-synaptic ones. We prove that our system has the conditional propagation of chaos property: as \\(N\\to +\\infty\\), the finite particle system converges to an infinite exchangeable system which obeys a McKean-Vlasov SDE driven by an \\(\\alpha\\)-stable process, and particles in the limit system are independent, conditionally on the driving \\(\\alpha\\)-stable process. SIR model on inhomogeneous graphs with infection-age dependent infectivity Aurelien Velleret (LaMME, Université Evry Paris Saclay) The prediction of epidemic spread within a population largely relies on simplified models, in which interactions are represented by means of implicit traits. These traits are characterizing the population heterogeneity, such as the age or occupation of individuals. The usual sampling methods are meant to provide estimations for the relation between the traits and the interaction levels, that is of the kernel function in the model. Starting from a stochastic individual based description of an epidemic spreading on a random graph, we will look at the dynamics as the size \\(n\\) of the graph tends to infinity. What is the generality of such a model reduction beyond the case of dense graphs for which the notion of graphon (as a specific case of interaction kernel) has been originally proposed? With the typical SIS infection process between individuals, we recover in the limit an infinite-dimensional integro-differential equation studied by Delmas, Dronnier and Zitt (2022) for an SIS epidemic propagating on a graphon. This convergence covers the cases both of dense and of sparse graphs, when the number of edges is of order \\(0(n^a)\\) with \\(a\\in(1,2]\\) (the case of very sparse graphs with \\(a=1\\) and boundedness properties in the number of neighbors is of different nature). This provides ground for the current statistical evaluation even though the individuals are in contact with typically a reduced portion of the entire population. These results can be extended for more elaborated infection history. When considering infectivity profiles that vary with the duration from the infection event, we recover in the limit an age-structured process that extends the description proposed in Forien, Pang and Pardoux (2022) for a finite number of individual traits. I will show how the involved propagation of chaos argument is then extended to this new graphon structure on a continuous state space. Bibliography \\([1]\\) G. Pang, E. Pardoux, and A.

We specify conditions which are sufficient to observe no dimension reduction and present exact asymptotics under restrictions - \\[\\label{assumpptionA} A \\gneqq \\bf 0, \\vec{ \\alpha} \\Sigma_{\\vec{ t}}^{-1} &gt; 0, \\quad \\vec{ \\alpha} &gt; \\vec{ 0},\\vec{ t }\\in [0,1]^d,\\] where the studied process \\(W_t\\) is defined as \\[\\vec{ W}(\\vec{ t}) = A \\vec{ B}(\\vec{ t})\\] with \\(\\vec{ B}(\\vec{ t})\\) \\(d-\\)dimensional Brownian motion with independent coordinates and \\(\\Sigma_{\\vec{ t}}\\) is a correlation matrix of \\(\\vec{ W}(\\vec{ t})\\). The conditions above enforce positive correlations between components. The above assumptions go in line with observations of real financial market, e.g. in \\([6]\\) it has been noticed that creating homogeneous groups is a viable strategy for designing the risk models for larger financial portfolios. As mentioned in \\([7]\\) large companies often show a positive correlation, since their performance is more dependent on the state of the economy as a whole than on the cross-company competition. Additionally, in many sectors a positive correlation between companies occurs because of high dependence of those sectors on external factors and hence the need to model positively correlated portfolios. Similarly, claims for specific kinds of insurance (i.e. weather insurance) can have high positive correlation. We additionally find what is the most likely time of ruin for \\(\\vec{ W} (\\vec{ t})\\) and provide upper bounds.

We prove that the \\(2\\)-neighbor graph percolates on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2\\), i.e., that the origin is connected to infinity with positive probability. The proof rests on duality, an exploration algorithm, a comparison to i.i.d. bond percolation under constraints as well as enhancement arguments. As a byproduct, we show that i.i.d. bond percolation with forbidden local patterns has a strictly larger percolation threshold than \\(1/2\\). Additionally, our main result provides further evidence that, in low dimensions, less variability is beneficial for percolation. Large-Deviation Analysis for Canonical Gibbs Measures Martina Petráková (Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University) Gibbs processes in the continuum are one of the most fundamental models in spatial stochastics. They are typically defined using a density with respect to the Poisson point process. In the language of statistical mechanics, this corresponds to the grand-canonical ensemble, where the number of particles is random. Of the same importance is the canonical ensemble, where the number of particles is fixed. In the language of point processes, this corresponds to studying binomial Gibbs processes which are defined using a density with respect to the binomial point process. In this talk, we present a large deviation theory developed for functionals of binomial Gibbs processes with fixed intensity in increasing windows. Our method relies on the traditional large deviation result from \\([1]\\) noting that the binomial point process is obtained from the Poisson point process by conditioning on the point number. Our main methodological contribution is the development of coupling constructions that allow us to handle delicate and unlikely pathological events. The presented results cover a broad class of both the interaction function (possibly unbounded) and the functionals (given as a sum of possibly unbounded local score functions).

Ordering and convergence of large degrees in random hyperbolic graphs Loïc Gassmann (University of Fribourg (Switzerland)) A random hyperbolic graph is constructed by sampling \\(n\\) points in a hyperbolic disc and connecting pairs of points that are within a distance smaller than a certain threshold \\(R_n\\). When the curvature parameter \\(\\alpha\\) is larger than \\(1/2\\) the graph is known to be a valid model for the so-called complex networks, which represent a broad class of real-world systems \\([1]\\). A complex networks is typically structured as follows: high-degree nodes are well connected to each other and serve as hubs for nodes with slightly lower degrees. These intermediate-degree nodes, in turn, connect to nodes with even lower degrees, and so on, forming a hierarchical structure. The specificity of the random hyperbolic graph, compared to other complex networks models, is its embedding in a geometric space. The closer a node is to the centre of the underlying hyperbolic disc, the more important it tends to be in the network hierarchy. In this talk, we investigate this property precisely by comparing the ranking of the nodes by increasing distance to the centre with the ranking of the nodes by decreasing degree. We show that in the scale-free regime (\\(\\alpha &gt; 1/2\\)), the rank at which these two rankings cease to coincide is \\(n^{1/(1+8\\alpha)+o(1)}\\), with high probability \\([2]\\). This rank marks the point beyond which spatial position no longer accurately reflects the importance of the nodes. We also give a precise description of the largest degrees of the graph by stating the convergence in distribution of the point process of the degrees toward an explicit Poisson point process, for all positive values of the curvature parameter \\(\\alpha\\). The transition at \\(\\alpha = 1/2\\) is characterised by a maximum degree having a distribution out of the class of extreme value distributions \\([2]\\).

For real-valued random processes with exchangeable increments on \\([0, 1]\\), Kallenberg’s result \\([1]\\) provides a complete characterisation of these processes via another mixing relationship. Continuum random trees are random tree-like metric spaces that arise naturally as scaling limits of various models of discrete random trees. In this talk, we will focus in particular on two subclasses of continuum random trees: the so-called stable trees and inhomogeneous continuum random trees. An analogue of Kallenberg’s Theorem for continuum random trees first appeared as a claim in a paper \\([2]\\) by Aldous, Miermont and Pitman. They suggested that, in much the same way that a stable bridge process on \\([0, 1]\\) is a mixing of certain extremal exchangeable processes, stable trees are mixings of inhomogeneous continuum random trees. We present an outline of a rigorous argument supporting this claim, based on a novel construction that applies to both classes of trees. We will also briefly discuss some implications of this result on critical random graphs. The talk is based on the paper \\([3]\\).

Boundary traces of diffusions Mateusz Kwaśnicki (Wrocław University of Science and Technology) In 1958 Spitzer \\([7]\\) showed that the 1-D Cauchy process (i.e., the symmetric 1-stable Lévy process) can be obtained from the paths of the reflected 2-D Brownian motion in the half-plane \\(\\mathbb H = \\mathbb R \\times [0, \\infty)\\) by retaining only points on the boundary \\(\\mathbb R \\times \\{0\\}\\), and rescaling time. A decade later Molchanov and Ostrovski \\([6]\\) proved that all symmetric stable Lévy processes arise similarly as boundary traces of suitable reflected diffusions. In PDEs, it is a classical result that the generator of the Cauchy process, \\(-(-\\Delta)^{1/2}\\), is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the Laplacian in \\(\\mathbb H\\). In 2008, Caffarelli and Silvestre \\([1]\\) generalised this by identifying the generator of the symmetric stable Lévy process with the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map corresponding to the second-order elliptic operator which is the generator of the diffusion in \\([6]\\). These results illustrate a general principle: the generator \\(K\\) of the boundary trace of a reflected diffusion with generator \\(L\\) often coincides with the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for \\(L\\). This idea has been explored further by Assing, Benjamini, Chen, Fukushima, Herman, Hsu, Kim, Kolsrud, Molchanov, Motoo, Nagasawa, Rohde, Sato, Song, Ueno, Vondraček, Ying, and others. Caffarelli and Silvestre posed a natural question: which translation-invariant operators arise as Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for elliptic operators in \\(\\mathbb H\\)? Probabilistically: which Lévy processes can be realised as boundary traces of reflected diffusions? An answer to the PDE version was given in my joint paper with Mucha \\([5]\\) for symmetric operators (in arbitrary dimension), and extended in \\([2]\\) to non-symmetric operators. However, the corresponding probabilistic result does not follow directly, known results on Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps and boundary traces are too restrictive. A full characterisation of Lévy processes that are traces of reflected diffusions in \\(\\mathbb H\\) was given in \\([3]\\), using a variety of probabilistic tools. The corresponding result for isotropic Lévy processes in higher dimensions appeared in \\([4]\\). In my talk I will state the problem more rigorously, survey the literature, and outline the main results of \\([3]\\) and \\([4]\\).

On the norm of random matrices with a tensor structure Benoit Collins (Kyoto University) The notion of strong convergence in random matrix theory refers to when the operator norm of a model of random matrices converges to the operator norm of the limit object. In general, one takes a sequence of (non-commuting) random matrices and tries to check for any non-commuting polynomial in these matrices, if its operator norm converges towards the operator norm of the limit object. Important milestones in this theory include the seminal work of Haagerup-Thorbjørnsen \\([1]\\), the work of Collins-Male \\([2]\\), and joint works with Bordenave \\([3,4,5]\\). In particular, the early strong convergence results did not allow us to understand models with tensor structure, and considerable progress has been made in \\([4,5]\\). We will describe in particular the following main result of \\([5]\\): Consider operators of type \\[\\text{Re} (a_0\\otimes 1_N+ \\sum_{i=1}^d a_i\\otimes U_i),\\] where \\(a_i\\) are \\(n\\times n\\) matrices and \\(U_i\\) are \\(N\\times N\\) iid Haar unitaries. Then, with high probability, the operator norm of this random matrix is close to the norm of the same operator when \\(U_i\\) are replaced by free Haar unitaries in the free group factor. In addition, there exists \\(a&gt;0\\) such that the above estimate is uniform over all possible choices of \\(a_i\\) as long as \\(n\\le \\exp (N^a)\\). We will present an outline of the operator algebraic tools needed to prove this result, and time allowing, we will discuss applications, in particular to a proof of the Peterson-Thom conjecture, as well as more recent developments \\([6]\\).
