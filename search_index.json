Discovered four decades ago in the context of card shuffling, this surprising phenomenon has since then been observed in a variety of models, from random walks on groups or complex networks to interacting particle systems. It is now believed to be universal among fast-mixing high-dimensional processes. Yet, current proofs are heavily model-dependent, and identifying the general conditions that trigger a cutoff remains one of the biggest challenges in the quantitative analysis of finite Markov chains. In this talk, I will provide a self-contained introduction to this fascinating question, and then describe a recent partial answer based on entropy and curvature. Joint work with Francesco Pedrotti. On rates in the central limit theorem for a class of convex costs Florence Merlevède In this talk, we will shall give estimates not only of the usual quadratic transportation cost, but also of a broader class of convex costs between normalized partial sums associated with real-valued random variables and their limiting Gaussian distribution. For the quadratic transport cost, estimates will be given in terms of weak-dependent coefficients that are well suited to a large class of dependent sequences. This class includes irreducible Markov chains, dynamical systems generated by intermittent maps or strong mixing sequences. We will also present very recent results in the independent framework for a broader class of convex costs that includes quadratic cost as a special case but also certain logarithmic costs such as \\(|x| \\ln (1+ |x|)\\). This talk is based on joint works with J. Dedecker and E. Rio. Critical long-range percolation Tom Hutchcroft Many statistical mechanics models on the lattice (including percolation, self-avoiding walk, the Ising model and so on) have natural \"long-range\" versions in which vertices interact not only with their neighbours, but with all other vertices in a way that decays with the distance. When this decay is described by a power-law, it can lead to new kinds of critical phenomena that are not present in the short-range models. I will describe a new approach to the study of these models that allows us to go well beyond what is known for short-range models, particularly in intermediate dimensions. On estimating Fr'{e}Chet means Roberto Imbuzeiro Oliveira A Fréchet mean (or barycenter) of a distribution \\(P\\) over a metric space \\((\\mathcal{X},d)\\) is any point \\[\\mu\\in {\\rm arg}\\min_{m\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\mathbb{E}_{X\\sim P}\\,d^2(X,m).\\] This definition makes sense for any \\((\\mathcal{X},d)\\), and coincides with the expectation of \\(P\\) if \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is Euclidean space. This talk considers the problem of estimating Fréchet means from an i.i.d. sample from \\(P\\), possibly contaminated by adversarial noise. The goal is to obtain optimal or-nearly optimal high probability bounds under weak moment assumptions on \\(P\\). Two main settings are considered. The first one consists of Alexandrov spaces where geodesics are “bi-extendible” in some precise quantitative sense, which is rich enough to include the space of probability measures over \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) with the Wasserstein-\\(2\\) distance. Our main theorem for this case refines an analysis of \\([1]\\), and obtains bounds with the “right” variance parameters The second setting we consider is that of uniformly convex Banach spaces of power type \\(2\\), where our results seem to be completely new. Both results are obtained via an analysis of certain “trimmed empirical processes”  that is based on previous work with Lucas Resende \\([2]\\). Bibliography \\([1]\\) T. Le Goı̈c, Q. Paris, P.

What AI will not tell you about white noise Krzysztof Burdzy This lecture is a brave attempt to show that human intelligence might still be useful in the era of artificial intelligence. White noise and Brownian motion are closely related fundamental concepts in science and mathematics. Their attraction stems in part from their paradoxical mixture of simplicity and complexity. The lecture will be illustrated and accessible to a wide audience.

In systems using (3), rather than directly accessing the shared resources upon arrival, a customer is considerate and waits to access them until nearby users in service have left. This new model can be seen as a missing piece of a larger puzzle that contains such dynamics as spatial birth-and-death processes, the Poisson-Hail model, and wireless dynamics as key other pieces. It is shown that, under natural assumptions, this model can be represented as a Markov process on the space of counting measures. The main results are then two-fold. The first is on the shape of the stability region and, more precisely, on the characterization of the critical value of the arrival rate that separates stability from instability. The second is of a more qualitative or perhaps even ethical nature. There is evidence that for natural values of the system parameters, the implementation of sensing and collision avoidance stabilizes a system that would be unstable if immediate access to the shared resources would be granted. In other words, for these parameters, renouncing greedy access makes sharing sustainable, whereas indulging in greedy access kills the system.

In this talk, we explore the proportional infinite-depth-and-width limit, where the role of depth can be adequately studied, and the limit remains a great model of finite size networks. At initialization, we characterize the limiting distribution of the network via a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the feature covariance matrix. Furthermore, in the linear network setting, we can also characterize the spectrum of the covariance matrix in the large data limit via a geometric variant of Dyson Brownian motions. Finally, we will briefly discuss ongoing work towards analyzing training dynamics.

There are strong practical motivations, however, to consider random graphs that are stochastically evolving, so as to model networks’ inherent dynamics. In this talk I’ll start by briefly discussing a set of dynamic random graph mechanisms and their probabilistic properties. Key results cover functional diffusion limits for subgraph counts (describing the behaviour around the mean) and a sample-path large-deviation principle (describing the rare-event behaviour, thus extending the seminal result for the static case developed by Chatterjee and Varadhan). The main part of my talk will be about estimation of the model parameters from partial information. We for instance demonstrate how the model’s underlying parameters can be estimated from just snapshots of the number of edges. We also consider settings in which particles move around on a dynamically evolving random graph, and in which the graph dynamics are inferred from the movements of the particles (i.e., not observing the graph process). Inference in infinite-server queueing networks with Poisson sampling Liron Ravner In this work, we study a network of n stations, each modeled as an infinite-server queue, where all arriving customers receive service in parallel. The network dynamics are governed by three key elements: external arrivals, per-station sojourn times, and the routing mechanism. Our objective is to estimate the system parameters based on periodic, noisy observations of customer counts at each station. These observations are collected through a Poisson sampling process. We derive the covariance structure of the observed counts and leverage it to develop consistent estimators for the system parameters.

The method embeds a Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition (SKPD) of the coefficient tensor within the two‑step MtMBSP strategy—sure screening followed by refitted posterior sampling. Each coefficient tensor is expressed through a Tucker expansion composed of sparse Kronecker products, and parsimony is induced by Truncated Poisson–Binomial–Normal (TPBN) shrinkage priors. Posterior inference is performed by an efficient Polya–Gamma‑augmented Gibbs sampler. We prove that SKPD‑MtMBSP preserves the sure‑screening property and achieves posterior contraction even when the number of tensor elements \\(p\\) grows exponentially with sample size \\(n\\). Simulations and analyses of ADNI and OASIS MRI data demonstrate high predictive accuracy for both and binary responses while reliably recovering the underlying brain image tensor structure under extreme dimensionality. Low-rank regularization of Fréchet regression models for distribution function response Kyunghee Han Fréchet regression has emerged as a useful tool for modeling non-Euclidean response variables associated with Euclidean covariates. In this work, we propose a global Fréchet regression estimation method that incorporates low-rank regularization. Focusing on distribution function responses, we demonstrate that leveraging the low-rank structure of the model parameters enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of model fitting. Through theoretical analysis of the large-sample properties, we show that the proposed method enables more robust modeling and estimation than standard dimension reduction techniques. We also present numerical experiments that evaluate the finite-sample performance to support our findings.

Brownian approximation for deterministic dynamical systems: a Stein’s method approach Juho Leppänen The classical functional central limit theorem (FCLT) asserts that, for a sequence of i.i.d. real random variables \\((X_i)\\) with zero mean and unit variance, the random process \\(W_n(t) = n^{-1/2} \\sum_{i = 1}^{ \\lfloor nt \\rfloor } X_i\\) converges in distribution to standard Brownian motion \\(B(t)\\). Using Stein’s method, Barbour \\[1\\] addressed the problem of estimating \\[\\begin{aligned} d_{\\mathcal{G}}( \\mathcal{L}(W_n), \\mathcal{L}(B) ) :=\\sup_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} | \\mathbb{E}(g ( W_n ) ) - \\mathbb{E} ( g(B) ) |, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is a class of test functions acting on the Skorokhod space of càdlàg functions, such that each \\(g \\in \\mathcal{G}\\) is twice Fréchet differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous second derivative. Building on Barbour’s approach, we estimate \\(d_{\\mathcal{G}}( \\mathcal{L}(W_n), \\mathcal{L}(B) )\\) under appropriate scaling for dynamical processes \\(X_i = f \\circ T^i\\), where \\(f\\) is a regular observable and \\(T: M \\to M\\) is an expanding/hyperbolic map of a probability space \\((M, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)\\). We derive correlation decay conditions for the FCLT augmented with an explicit upper bound on \\(d_{\\mathcal{G}}( \\mathcal{L}(W_n), \\mathcal{L}(B) )\\). Examples of systems satisfying these conditions include dispersing Sinai billiards, intermittent maps with critical points and/or singularities, and open dynamical systems composed of piecewise smooth expanding maps. In addition to conventional measure-preserving systems, we also obtain error bounds for nonautonomous systems \\(X_n = f_n \\circ T_n \\circ \\cdots \\circ T_1\\) described by sequential compositions of deterministically/randomly varying hyperbolic maps \\(T_n\\) and observables \\(f_n\\).

Goggin proved that transforming the observations by the score function and then applying the Kalman Filter (KF) to the transformed observations results in an asymptotically optimal filter. In the current paper, we study the convergence rate of Goggin’s filter in a pre-limit setting that allows us to study a range of signal-to-noise regimes which includes, as a special case, Goggin’s setting. Our guarantees are explicit in the level of observation noise, and importantly, we do not assume Gaussianity of the noises. Our proofs build on combining simple tools from two separate literature streams. One is a general posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound for filtering. The other is convergence-rate bounds in the Fisher information central limit theorem. Along the way, we also study filtering regimes for linear state-space models, characterizing clearly degenerate regimes—where trivial filters are nearly optimal—and a balanced regime, which is where Goggin’s filter has the most value.

This extends the result of Fraser and Sahlsten (2018) for the Brownian motion and verifies partly the conjecture of Fraser, Orponen and Sahlsten (2014). We introduce a combinatorial integration by parts formula to compute the moments of the Fourier transform of the graph measure. The proof of our main result is based on this integration by parts formula together with Faà di Bruno’s formula and strong local nondeterminism of fractional Brownian motion. We also show that the Fourier dimension of the graph of a symmetric \\(\\alpha\\)-stable process with \\(\\alpha\\in[1,2]\\) is almost surely 1.

We call this graph the directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph. Two natural associated undirected graphs are the undirected and the bidirectional \\(k\\)-neighbor graph, where we connect two vertices by an undirected edge whenever there is a directed edge in the directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph between them in at least one, respectively precisely two, directions. In these graphs we study the question of percolation, i.e., the existence of an infinite self-avoiding path. Using different kinds of proof techniques for different classes of cases, we show that for \\(k=1\\) even the undirected \\(k\\)-neighbor graph never percolates, but the directed one percolates whenever \\(k \\geq d+1\\). Our main result is the following. Theorem. The directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph percolates when \\(k \\geq 3\\) and \\(d \\geq 5\\), or \\(k=d=4\\). The proof of this result is based on a technique developed by Cox and Durrett \\([2]\\) (1983) for verifying the existence of an infinite oriented path in higher-dimensional oriented percolation. We also show that the undirected 2-neighbor graph percolates for \\(d=2\\), the undirected 3-neighbor graph percolates for \\(d=3\\), and we provide some positive and negative percolation results regarding the bidirectional graph as well. A heuristic argument for high dimensions indicates that this class of models is a natural discrete analogue of the -nearest-neighbor graphs studied in continuum percolation, and our results support this interpretation.

The process \\(\\{X(t)\\}\\) is labelled as anomalous diffusive if its second moment grows in time as a power-law function, i.e., \\[\\label{eq1} \\mathbb{E} \\left(X^2(t)\\right)=2Dt^{\\alpha} \\,,\\] where \\(\\alpha\\in[0,2]\\) is the anomalous exponent and \\(D\\in[0,\\infty)\\) is the generalized diffusion coefficient (called also diffusion coefficient). The classical example of the anomalous diffusive class is the fractional Brownian motion (FBM) \\(\\{B_{H}(t)~t\\geq 0\\}\\) that is continuous centred Gaussian process defined through the integral representation \\[1\\] \\[\\begin{aligned} \\label{FBM_main} B_{H}(t) =A_{H}\\Bigg[\\int_{0}^{t}(t-u)^{H-1/2}d\\tilde{B}(u) +\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\mspace{-4mu}\\left((t-u)^{H-1/2}-(-u)^{H-1/2}\\right)d\\tilde{B}(u)\\Bigg] \\mspace{-4mu}, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(0&lt;H&lt;1\\) is the Hurst exponent. The process \\(\\{\\tilde{B}(t),~t\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\) is the extension of ordinary Brownian motion to the negative time axis defined as \\[\\tilde{B}(t)= \\begin{cases} B_1(t) ~ \\mbox{for}~t&gt;0,\\\\ B_2(-t) ~\\mbox{for}~ t\\leq 0, \\end{cases}\\] where \\(\\{B_1(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) and \\(\\{B_2(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) are two independent ordinary Brownian motions. Let us note that the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) determines the anomalous diffusion behavior of FBM and \\(\\alpha\\) in the equation (\\[eq1\\]) is equal to \\(2H\\). However, recent empirical findings suggest that classical anomalous diffusion models often fail to adequately capture the underlying dynamics of such phenomena. Consequently, contemporary research has proposed numerous modifications to these models in order to better represent the specific behaviors observed in real data. One such modification involves the incorporation of random parameters that govern anomalous diffusion within traditional models. During the presentation, we introduce a novel conceptual approach to anomalous diffusion modeling, with a particular focus on FBM and its multifractional extension. In these models, the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) is replaced by a suitable randomly chosen variable \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) or a stochastic process \\(\\{\\mathcal{H}(t)\\}\\), respectively. We examine the fundamental probabilistic properties of the models discussed and discuss methodologies for their application to empirical data. The presentation concludes with several illustrative examples based on real-world datasets.

A natural generalization of the exponential distribution to the matrix-valued setting exists; however, it is not infinitely divisible and therefore cannot be directly used to define a matrix-valued gamma motion, see \\([3]\\). In existing literature, see \\([1]\\), the Lévy–Khintchine representation on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices has been employed to construct infinitely divisible matrix-valued analogues of gamma distributions. In this work, we propose three alternative approaches that yield distinct infinitely divisible distributions on the cone, while retaining the direct use of the natural matrix-valued exponential distribution. The first approach introduces a novel Lévy motion with multivariate argument and thus defined on the non-negative orthant, resulting in a multivariate shape (divisibility) parameter. This construction reveals a simple relationship with the classical matrix gamma distribution, which has a scalar shape parameter. The second and third constructions involve one-dimensional divisibility parameters and can be seen as natural matrix-valued extensions of the Bondesson shot-noise representation of the one-dimensional gamma motion, see \\([2]\\), where the matrix exponential distribution governs the jump sizes. Compared to prior constructions, the proposed models offer advantages such as explicit analytical expressions for many of their properties and straightforward simulation algorithms. These features make the models well-suited for applications in stochastic modeling, especially where stochastic integration is required and both theoretical analysis and computation must remain tractable.

Free probability: Free probability, developed in large part by Voiculescu, is a theory of non-commuting random variables which can be used the describe the large-\\(n\\) behavior of certain \\(n \\times n\\) random matrices. The idea is that the algebra of classical random variables \\(L^\\infty(\\Omega,P)\\) is replaced by a non-commutative von Neumann algebra and the expectation is replaced by a tracial state \\(\\tau: M \\to \\mathbb{C}\\). The role of the normal distribution from classical probability is played by Wigner’s semicircular distribution, and classical independence is replaced by free independence, a condition motivated by free products of groups. In particular, a \\(d\\)-variable free Brownian motion is a process \\(S_t = (S_t^{(1)},\\dots,S_t^{(d)})\\) where the increments are freely independent and the different coordinates are also freely independent. A free Brownian motion describes the large-\\(n\\) behavior of a Brownian motion on the space \\(M_n(\\mathbb{C})_{\\operatorname{sa}}^d\\) of \\(d\\)-tuples of self-adjoint matrices. Stochastic optimization problems: We consider stochastic optimization problems that using both a free Brownian motion \\(S_t\\) and a classical Brownian \\(W_t\\); these processes are thus classical random objects taking values in a tracial von Neumann algebra, equipped with both classical and non-commutative filtrations. We consider processes satisfying \\[dX_t = \\beta_F dS_t + \\beta_C \\,dW_t + \\alpha_t\\,dt,\\] where \\(\\alpha_t\\) is a control that we want to choose. The stochastic optimization problem is \\[\\text{minimize } \\mathbb{E} [\\int_0^1 L(X_t,\\alpha_t)\\,dt + g(X_1)] \\text{ over } \\alpha,\\] where the running cost \\(L\\) and the terminal cost \\(g\\) are given functions that can be evaluated on non-commuting random variables. The inclusion of both \\(S_t\\) and \\(W_t\\) is motivated by mean field game theory (see \\([2]\\)): The \\(S_t\\) represents individual noise associated to a single player (motivated by the Brownian motion that affects all the matrix entries), and the \\(W_t\\) represents a common noise that affects all the players (which in the matrix model would be a random scalar multiple of the identity matrix added to each of the \\(d\\) matrices). Results: We study the value of the minimization problem as a function of the initial condition \\(X_0\\), and show that it satisfies a non-commutative version of the dynamic programming principle and Hamilton–Jacobi equation. A key challenge is that the value of the optimization problem may depend on the choice of ambient von Neumann algebra \\(M\\) and filtration. We thus take the infimum over all choices of \\(M\\) as well, and analyze how to join together different given choices of \\(M\\). However, under certain convexity assumptions, the answer is the same regardless of the choice of \\(M\\), and in this case we can show that the value of the free stochastic optimal problem gives the large-\\(n\\) limit of matrix optimal control problems. We remark that special cases of this setup relate closely with free entropy theory and the large deviation principle of Biane, Capitaine, and Guionnet \\([3]\\).

Schickentanz (Paderborn University) Persistence of Strongly Correlated Stationary Gaussian fields: From Universal Probability Decay to Entropic Repulsion Ohad Noy Feldheim We study the persistence event (i.e., the event that the field remains positive on a large ball) for stationary Gaussian fields on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) or \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d\\), whose correlation function is non-summable and asymptotically positively correlated (a spectral singularity at the origin). Firstly, we give precise log-asymptotics for the persistence probability in terms of capacity, expressed in terms of the order of the singularity at the origin. We then establish that the field conditioned to persist is propelled to height \\(C\\sqrt{\\log T}\\) and takes the shape of a deterministic function (the “equilibrium potential”). This generalises a classical result of Bolthausen, Deuschel and Zeitouni for the Gaussian free field (GFF) on \\(\\mathbb{Z}^d\\), \\(d \\ge 3\\), to a wide class of Gaussian fields with spectral singularity, showing that both the leading order of persistence probability decay and entropic repulsion are, in a sense, universal, depending only on the order of the spectral singularity.

The proposed model consists of a superposition of cosines with a nonstationary phase shift process and a stationary amplitude process. The asymptotic properties of the first- and second-order moments of the considered process are investigated. Estimators of the asymptotic mean and autocovariance functions are introduced. The performance of the autocovariance function estimator is examined in a simulation study. Finally, the model is applied to a real biomedical dataset.

Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a global weak solution of the above equation, as well as upper and lower bounds for the probability that the solution does not blow up in finite time. On the explosion time of a semilinear stochastic partial differential equations driven by a mixture of Brownian and fractional Brownian motion Ekaterina Todorova Kolkovska We study the blowup behaviour of a semilinear stochastic patial differential equation driven by a mixture of Brownian and fractional Brownian motion. We give estimates for the probability of finite time blowup and the blowup before a given fixed time. We show the influence of the biggest eigenvalue of the generator and the other parameters of the equation on the occurence of a blowup in finite time.

Every particle jumps with a rate depending on its position. When this happens, all the other particles of the system receive a same random kick distributed according to a heavy tailed random variable belonging to the domain of attraction of an \\(\\alpha\\)-stable law and scaled by \\(N^{-1/\\alpha}\\), \\(\\alpha \\in (0,2)\\setminus \\{1\\}\\). We call these jumps collateral jumps. Moreover, in case \\(0&lt;\\alpha&lt;1\\), the jumping particle itself undergoes a macroscopic, main jump. Similar systems are employed to model families of interacting neurons and, in that context, main and collateral jumps represent respectively the hyperpolarization of a neuron after a spike and the synaptic inputs received by post-synaptic neurons from pre-synaptic ones. We prove that our system has the conditional propagation of chaos property: as \\(N\\to +\\infty\\), the finite particle system converges to an infinite exchangeable system which obeys a McKean-Vlasov SDE driven by an \\(\\alpha\\)-stable process, and particles in the limit system are independent, conditionally on the driving \\(\\alpha\\)-stable process.

In this context, \\(\\xi(t)\\) represents a stationary Gaussian process, while \\(g(t)\\) is a deterministic function. The inclusion of the trend function \\(g(t)\\) disrupts stationarity, making it challenging to apply classical results. We provide the normalizing constants \\(a_T\\) and \\(b_T\\) such that \\(a_T(\\max_{t \\in [0,T]} X(t) - b_T)\\) converges to a mixed Gumbel distribution as \\(T \\to \\infty\\). Notably, the normalizing constant \\(a_T\\) appears to be unaffected by the introduction of the trend, whereas the constant \\(b_T\\) is influenced by it. Bibliography \\([1]\\) V. I.

Traditional statistical models often fall short in capturing the nonlinear dynamics and unstructured signals embedded in textual data. This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA family, to enhance predictive performance by integrating historical price data with financial news. We compare LLaMA 3.3 with LLaMA 3.1 and a benchmark ARIMA model, evaluating their ability to capture both time series patterns and sentiment-driven signals. Results show that LLaMA 3.3 significantly outperforms the alternatives, confirming the added value of incorporating news sentiment into the forecasting process. The findings underscore the potential of LLM-based approaches to improve market predictions by fusing structured and unstructured data, with implications for traders, analysts, and financial institutions. Future research will focus on domain-specific fine-tuning and enhancing model interpretability.
