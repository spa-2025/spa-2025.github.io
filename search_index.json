Discovered four decades ago in the context of card shuffling, this surprising phenomenon has since then been observed in a variety of models, from random walks on groups or complex networks to interacting particle systems. It is now believed to be universal among fast-mixing high-dimensional processes. Yet, current proofs are heavily model-dependent, and identifying the general conditions that trigger a cutoff remains one of the biggest challenges in the quantitative analysis of finite Markov chains. In this talk, I will provide a self-contained introduction to this fascinating question, and then describe a recent partial answer based on entropy and curvature. Joint work with Francesco Pedrotti. On rates in the central limit theorem for a class of convex costs Florence Merlevède In this talk, we will shall give estimates not only of the usual quadratic transportation cost, but also of a broader class of convex costs between normalized partial sums associated with real-valued random variables and their limiting Gaussian distribution. For the quadratic transport cost, estimates will be given in terms of weak-dependent coefficients that are well suited to a large class of dependent sequences. This class includes irreducible Markov chains, dynamical systems generated by intermittent maps or strong mixing sequences. We will also present very recent results in the independent framework for a broader class of convex costs that includes quadratic cost as a special case but also certain logarithmic costs such as \\(|x| \\ln (1+ |x|)\\). This talk is based on joint works with J. Dedecker and E. Rio. Critical long-range percolation Tom Hutchcroft Many statistical mechanics models on the lattice (including percolation, self-avoiding walk, the Ising model and so on) have natural \"long-range\" versions in which vertices interact not only with their neighbours, but with all other vertices in a way that decays with the distance. When this decay is described by a power-law, it can lead to new kinds of critical phenomena that are not present in the short-range models. I will describe a new approach to the study of these models that allows us to go well beyond what is known for short-range models, particularly in intermediate dimensions. On estimating Fr'{e}Chet means Roberto Imbuzeiro Oliveira A Fréchet mean (or barycenter) of a distribution \\(P\\) over a metric space \\((\\mathcal{X},d)\\) is any point \\[\\mu\\in {\\rm arg}\\min_{m\\in\\mathcal{X}}\\mathbb{E}_{X\\sim P}\\,d^2(X,m).\\] This definition makes sense for any \\((\\mathcal{X},d)\\), and coincides with the expectation of \\(P\\) if \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) is Euclidean space. This talk considers the problem of estimating Fréchet means from an i.i.d. sample from \\(P\\), possibly contaminated by adversarial noise. The goal is to obtain optimal or-nearly optimal high probability bounds under weak moment assumptions on \\(P\\). Two main settings are considered. The first one consists of Alexandrov spaces where geodesics are “bi-extendible” in some precise quantitative sense, which is rich enough to include the space of probability measures over \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) with the Wasserstein-\\(2\\) distance. Our main theorem for this case refines an analysis of \\([1]\\), and obtains bounds with the “right” variance parameters The second setting we consider is that of uniformly convex Banach spaces of power type \\(2\\), where our results seem to be completely new. Both results are obtained via an analysis of certain “trimmed empirical processes”  that is based on previous work with Lucas Resende \\([2]\\). Bibliography \\([1]\\) T. Le Goı̈c, Q. Paris, P.

What AI will not tell you about white noise Krzysztof Burdzy This lecture is a brave attempt to show that human intelligence might still be useful in the era of artificial intelligence. White noise and Brownian motion are closely related fundamental concepts in science and mathematics. Their attraction stems in part from their paradoxical mixture of simplicity and complexity. The lecture will be illustrated and accessible to a wide audience. Exchangeability in Continuum Random Trees Minmin Wang De Fenetti’s Theorem states that all \\(\\mathbb N\\)-indexed exchangeable sequences of real-valued random variables are mixings of i.i.d sequences. For real-valued random processes with exchangeable increments on \\([0, 1]\\), Kallenberg’s result \\([1]\\) provides a complete characterisation of these processes via another mixing relationship. Continuum random trees are random tree-like metric spaces that arise naturally as scaling limits of various models of discrete random trees. In this talk, we will focus in particular on two subclasses of continuum random trees: the so-called stable trees and inhomogeneous continuum random trees. An analogue of Kallenberg’s Theorem for continuum random trees first appeared as a claim in a paper \\([2]\\) by Aldous, Miermont and Pitman. They suggested that, in much the same way that a stable bridge process on \\([0, 1]\\) is a mixing of certain extremal exchangeable processes, stable trees are mixings of inhomogeneous continuum random trees. We present an outline of a rigorous argument supporting this claim, based on a novel construction that applies to both classes of trees. We will also briefly discuss some implications of this result on critical random graphs. The talk is based on the paper \\([3]\\).

Bootstrap percolation and kinetically constrained models: universality results Toninelli Cristina Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the study of bootstrap percolation (BP) models. In the initial configuration sites are occupied with probability p. The evolution of BP proceeds in discrete time: empty sites remain empty, while occupied sites become empty if and only if a certain model-dependent neighborhood is already empty. On Z^d there is now a fairly complete understanding of the dynamics starting from random initial conditions, along with a clear universality picture for their critical behavior. Much less is known about their non-monotone stochastic counterpart, namely kinetically constrained models (KCM). In these models each vertex is either infected or healthy and, iff it is infectable according to the BP rules, its state is resampled (independently) at rate one and becomes infected with probability p, and healthy with probability 1-p. These models, introduced and intensively studied in physics literature as toy models of the liquid/glass transition, present both challenging and fascinating mathematical problems. Indeed, the presence of constraints induce non-attractiveness, multiple invariant measures, and the breakdown of many powerful tools (such as coercive inequalities, coupling arguments, and censoring techniques) typically used to study convergence to equilibrium. In this talk, I will present a series of results that establish the full universality picture of KCM in two dimensions. We will see that, compared to those of BP, the universality classes for the stochastic dynamics are richer and the critical time scales diverge more rapidly due to the dominant role of energy barriers. The seminar is based on joint works with I.Hartarsky, L.Marêché, F.Martinelli, and R.Morris.

Agnieszka Janicka From power blackouts to traffic jams and financial crises, cascading failures pose a persistent threat to networks. These events rarely remain isolated — an initial failure can propagate through the system, leading to widespread disruption. Notably, across domains, the associated costs often follow heavy-tailed distributions. Our work provides a mathematically rigorous modeling framework that explains the emergence of this phenomenon. In this talk, I will present our stochastic, multi-commodity model for overload cascading failures — events triggered when flows exceed component capacities. Flows and resources are allocated optimally, following the principle of minimum energy dissipation. This formulation offers a flexible, yet analytically tractable framework applicable across diverse systems. Our results suggest that, despite domain-specific complexities, a common underlying driver — exogenous heavy-tailed inputs — may be responsible for the heavy-tailed nature of cascade costs. We derive probabilistic results that characterize when and why these costs inherit the input’s tail behavior. In particular, we show that large costs arise with high probability when a single location exhibits disproportionately high resource requirements — a phenomenon reminiscent of the catastrophe principle. The analysis also relies on continuity and scale-invariance properties of the cascade cost function, which we establish for several broad classes of modeling choices. This work deepens our understanding of cascading failures in complex systems and provides a unifying framework for analyzing large-scale disruptions, laying the groundwork for resilience analysis and policy design.

One the vertices serves as a ‘sink’, where particles are removed from the system.

For the purposes of computational tractability, the TBPTT algorithm truncates the chain rule and calculates the gradient on a finite block of the overall data sequence. Such approximation could lead to significant inaccuracies, as the block length for the truncated backpropagation is typically limited to be much smaller than the overall sequence length. In contrast, Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is an online optimization algorithm which asymptotically follows the true gradient of the loss on the data sequence as the number of sequence time steps t→∞. RTRL forward propagates the derivatives of the RNN hidden/memory units with respect to the parameters and, using the forward derivatives, performs online updates of the parameters at each time step in the data sequence. RTRL’s online forward propagation allows for exact optimization over extremely long data sequences, although it can be computationally costly for models with large numbers of parameters. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm for a class of RNNs. The convergence analysis establishes a fixed point for the joint distribution of the data sequence, RNN hidden layer, and the RNN hidden layer forward derivatives as the number of data samples from the sequence and the number of training steps tend to infinity. We prove convergence of the RTRL algorithm to a stationary point of the loss. Numerical studies illustrate our theoretical results. One potential application area for RTRL is the analysis of financial data, which typically involve long time series and models with small to medium numbers of parameters. This makes RTRL computationally tractable and a potentially appealing optimization method for training models. Thus, we include an example of RTRL applied to limit order book data.

In systems using (3), rather than directly accessing the shared resources upon arrival, a customer is considerate and waits to access them until nearby users in service have left. This new model can be seen as a missing piece of a larger puzzle that contains such dynamics as spatial birth-and-death processes, the Poisson-Hail model, and wireless dynamics as key other pieces. It is shown that, under natural assumptions, this model can be represented as a Markov process on the space of counting measures. The main results are then two-fold. The first is on the shape of the stability region and, more precisely, on the characterization of the critical value of the arrival rate that separates stability from instability. The second is of a more qualitative or perhaps even ethical nature. There is evidence that for natural values of the system parameters, the implementation of sensing and collision avoidance stabilizes a system that would be unstable if immediate access to the shared resources would be granted. In other words, for these parameters, renouncing greedy access makes sharing sustainable, whereas indulging in greedy access kills the system.

In this talk, we explore the proportional infinite-depth-and-width limit, where the role of depth can be adequately studied, and the limit remains a great model of finite size networks. At initialization, we characterize the limiting distribution of the network via a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the feature covariance matrix. Furthermore, in the linear network setting, we can also characterize the spectrum of the covariance matrix in the large data limit via a geometric variant of Dyson Brownian motions. Finally, we will briefly discuss ongoing work towards analyzing training dynamics.

Stochastic and dynamical approaches to non-Hermitian matrix-valued processes Makoto Katori One of the main topics of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to establish useful mathematical descriptions of open systems, in which flows of energy, particles, and information to external degrees of freedom play essential roles. For this purpose, a variety of models associated with non-Hermitian operators and matrices have been extensively studied in a new research field called non-Hermitian physics. Motivated by such a new trend, we will report the stochastic analysis of non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion (BM) and related stochastic processes. In contrast to Dyson’s BM models describing the eigenvalue processes of the Hermitian matrix-valued BMs, the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of the eigenvalue processes are coupled with those of the eigenvector-overlap processes.

There are strong practical motivations, however, to consider random graphs that are stochastically evolving, so as to model networks’ inherent dynamics. In this talk I’ll start by briefly discussing a set of dynamic random graph mechanisms and their probabilistic properties. Key results cover functional diffusion limits for subgraph counts (describing the behaviour around the mean) and a sample-path large-deviation principle (describing the rare-event behaviour, thus extending the seminal result for the static case developed by Chatterjee and Varadhan). The main part of my talk will be about estimation of the model parameters from partial information. We for instance demonstrate how the model’s underlying parameters can be estimated from just snapshots of the number of edges. We also consider settings in which particles move around on a dynamically evolving random graph, and in which the graph dynamics are inferred from the movements of the particles (i.e., not observing the graph process). Inference in infinite-server queueing networks with Poisson sampling Liron Ravner In this work, we study a network of n stations, each modeled as an infinite-server queue, where all arriving customers receive service in parallel. The network dynamics are governed by three key elements: external arrivals, per-station sojourn times, and the routing mechanism. Our objective is to estimate the system parameters based on periodic, noisy observations of customer counts at each station. These observations are collected through a Poisson sampling process. We derive the covariance structure of the observed counts and leverage it to develop consistent estimators for the system parameters.

The method embeds a Sparse Kronecker Product Decomposition (SKPD) of the coefficient tensor within the two‑step MtMBSP strategy—sure screening followed by refitted posterior sampling. Each coefficient tensor is expressed through a Tucker expansion composed of sparse Kronecker products, and parsimony is induced by Truncated Poisson–Binomial–Normal (TPBN) shrinkage priors. Posterior inference is performed by an efficient Polya–Gamma‑augmented Gibbs sampler. We prove that SKPD‑MtMBSP preserves the sure‑screening property and achieves posterior contraction even when the number of tensor elements \\(p\\) grows exponentially with sample size \\(n\\).

Low-rank regularization of Fréchet regression models for distribution function response Kyunghee Han Fréchet regression has emerged as a useful tool for modeling non-Euclidean response variables associated with Euclidean covariates. In this work, we propose a global Fréchet regression estimation method that incorporates low-rank regularization. Focusing on distribution function responses, we demonstrate that leveraging the low-rank structure of the model parameters enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of model fitting. Through theoretical analysis of the large-sample properties, we show that the proposed method enables more robust modeling and estimation than standard dimension reduction techniques. We also present numerical experiments that evaluate the finite-sample performance to support our findings.

Brownian approximation for deterministic dynamical systems: a Stein’s method approach Juho Leppänen The classical functional central limit theorem (FCLT) asserts that, for a sequence of i.i.d. real random variables \\((X_i)\\) with zero mean and unit variance, the random process \\(W_n(t) = n^{-1/2} \\sum_{i = 1}^{ \\lfloor nt \\rfloor } X_i\\) converges in distribution to standard Brownian motion \\(B(t)\\). Using Stein’s method, Barbour \\[1\\] addressed the problem of estimating \\[\\begin{aligned} d_{\\mathcal{G}}( \\mathcal{L}(W_n), \\mathcal{L}(B) ) :=\\sup_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}} | \\mathbb{E}(g ( W_n ) ) - \\mathbb{E} ( g(B) ) |, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is a class of test functions acting on the Skorokhod space of càdlàg functions, such that each \\(g \\in \\mathcal{G}\\) is twice Fréchet differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous second derivative. Building on Barbour’s approach, we estimate \\(d_{\\mathcal{G}}( \\mathcal{L}(W_n), \\mathcal{L}(B) )\\) under appropriate scaling for dynamical processes \\(X_i = f \\circ T^i\\), where \\(f\\) is a regular observable and \\(T: M \\to M\\) is an expanding/hyperbolic map of a probability space \\((M, \\mathcal{F}, \\mu)\\).

Examples of systems satisfying these conditions include dispersing Sinai billiards, intermittent maps with critical points and/or singularities, and open dynamical systems composed of piecewise smooth expanding maps.

Normal approximation for exponential random graphs Xiao Fang The question of whether the central limit theorem (CLT) holds for the total number of edges in exponential random graph models (ERGMs) in the subcritical region of parameters has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish the CLT. As a result of our proof, we also derive a convergence rate for the CLT, an explicit formula for the asymptotic variance, and the CLT for general subgraph counts. To establish our main result, we develop Stein’s method for the normal approximation of general functionals of nonlinear exponential families of random variables, which is of independent interest. In addition to ERGMs, our general theorem can also be applied to other models. A key ingredient needed in our proof for the ERGM is a higher-order concentration inequality, which was known in a subset of the subcritical region called Dobrushin’s uniqueness region. We use Stein’s method to partially generalize such inequalities to the subcritical region.

Goggin proved that transforming the observations by the score function and then applying the Kalman Filter (KF) to the transformed observations results in an asymptotically optimal filter. In the current paper, we study the convergence rate of Goggin’s filter in a pre-limit setting that allows us to study a range of signal-to-noise regimes which includes, as a special case, Goggin’s setting. Our guarantees are explicit in the level of observation noise, and importantly, we do not assume Gaussianity of the noises. Our proofs build on combining simple tools from two separate literature streams. One is a general posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound for filtering. The other is convergence-rate bounds in the Fisher information central limit theorem. Along the way, we also study filtering regimes for linear state-space models, characterizing clearly degenerate regimes—where trivial filters are nearly optimal—and a balanced regime, which is where Goggin’s filter has the most value.

This extends the result of Fraser and Sahlsten (2018) for the Brownian motion and verifies partly the conjecture of Fraser, Orponen and Sahlsten (2014). We introduce a combinatorial integration by parts formula to compute the moments of the Fourier transform of the graph measure. The proof of our main result is based on this integration by parts formula together with Faà di Bruno’s formula and strong local nondeterminism of fractional Brownian motion. We also show that the Fourier dimension of the graph of a symmetric \\(\\alpha\\)-stable process with \\(\\alpha\\in[1,2]\\) is almost surely 1.

Scaling limit of dependent random walks Jeonghwa Lee Recently, a generalized Bernoulli process (GBP) was developed as a stationary binary sequence that can have long-range dependence, and it was further broadened to include various covariance functions. In this work, we find the scaling limits of dependent random walks that follow GBPs and the dependence structure of the limiting processes. We show that the second-type Mittag-Leffler process and exponential process arise as the limiting processes. Compound processes are considered with a Levy process subordinated to the cumulative sum in GBP, and the asymptotic properties and dependence structure of the subordinated processes are discussed. Applications of GBP are provided with datasets in economics and horticulture.

We develop such a model, explicitly accounting for the complex dependencies between regional catastrophe losses. Specifically, we explore scenarios ranging from complete independence to proportional loss dependencies, both with fixed and random loss amounts.

Dr Joanna Janczura We propose a new method for probabilistic forecasting of electricity prices. It is based on averaging point forecasts from different models combined with expectile regression. We show that deriving the predicted distribution in terms of expectiles, might be in some cases advantageous to the commonly used quantiles. Using expectile predictions as a future risk measure we propose a short-term diversification strategy for an electricity trader. The proposed methods are applied to the day-ahead electricity prices from the German market.

We call this graph the directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph. Two natural associated undirected graphs are the undirected and the bidirectional \\(k\\)-neighbor graph, where we connect two vertices by an undirected edge whenever there is a directed edge in the directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph between them in at least one, respectively precisely two, directions. In these graphs we study the question of percolation, i.e., the existence of an infinite self-avoiding path. Using different kinds of proof techniques for different classes of cases, we show that for \\(k=1\\) even the undirected \\(k\\)-neighbor graph never percolates, but the directed one percolates whenever \\(k \\geq d+1\\). Our main result is the following. Theorem. The directed \\(k\\)-neighbor graph percolates when \\(k \\geq 3\\) and \\(d \\geq 5\\), or \\(k=d=4\\). The proof of this result is based on a technique developed by Cox and Durrett \\([2]\\) (1983) for verifying the existence of an infinite oriented path in higher-dimensional oriented percolation.

A heuristic argument for high dimensions indicates that this class of models is a natural discrete analogue of the -nearest-neighbor graphs studied in continuum percolation, and our results support this interpretation.

Comp. 54 (2023), 171-198 Step Reinforced Random Walks with Regularly Varying Memory Aritra Majumdar The Step Reinforced Random Walk (SRRW) is a generalization of the usual random walk with memory. The walker, at every epoch, chooses a past step uniformly at random; repeats it with probability \\(p\\) or innovates with probability \\(1-p\\), independent of the past. Here, \\(p\\) is called the memory parameter. The SRRW has been a subject of great interest in the last few decades, since it exhibits a phase transition from diffusive to superdiffusive behavior, based on \\(p\\) unlike the usual walk. Bertenghi and Laulin (2024) studied a variant of the SRRW in which the past step is selected with probability proportional to a weight sequence that is regularly varying of index \\(\\gamma&gt;-1\\). The innovation steps were assumed to be independent and identically distributed with finite variance. The law of large numbers and fluctuations around the large number limit have been obtained for certain values of \\(p\\in \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma+1},\\frac{\\gamma+1/2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)\\) and \\(\\gamma\\geq 0\\). In this talk, we shall provide a complete picture of the limiting behavior of the random walk; the law of large numbers and functional limit theorems for all \\(p\\in[0,1]\\) and \\(\\gamma&gt;-1\\). We discuss the phase transition emerging in such a walk with novel superdiffusive scalings in the critical regime. Along with the usual \\(\\sqrt{n\\log n}\\) scale observed for the SRRW, a variety of different scalings (e.g. \\(\\sqrt{n(\\log n)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\), \\(\\sqrt{n(\\log n)^{-2}}\\), \\(\\sqrt{n\\log n\\log\\log n}\\) etc.) appear in the generalized walk.

Theory and Applications. Agnieszka Wyłomańska Anomalous diffusion processes have been widely discussed in the literature. The process \\(\\{X(t)\\}\\) is labelled as anomalous diffusive if its second moment grows in time as a power-law function, i.e., \\[\\label{eq1} \\mathbb{E} \\left(X^2(t)\\right)=2Dt^{\\alpha} \\,,\\] where \\(\\alpha\\in[0,2]\\) is the anomalous exponent and \\(D\\in[0,\\infty)\\) is the generalized diffusion coefficient (called also diffusion coefficient). The classical example of the anomalous diffusive class is the fractional Brownian motion (FBM) \\(\\{B_{H}(t)~t\\geq 0\\}\\) that is continuous centred Gaussian process defined through the integral representation \\[1\\] \\[\\begin{aligned} \\label{FBM_main} B_{H}(t) =A_{H}\\Bigg[\\int_{0}^{t}(t-u)^{H-1/2}d\\tilde{B}(u) +\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\mspace{-4mu}\\left((t-u)^{H-1/2}-(-u)^{H-1/2}\\right)d\\tilde{B}(u)\\Bigg] \\mspace{-4mu}, \\end{aligned}\\] where \\(0&lt;H&lt;1\\) is the Hurst exponent. The process \\(\\{\\tilde{B}(t),~t\\in \\mathbb{R}\\}\\) is the extension of ordinary Brownian motion to the negative time axis defined as \\[\\tilde{B}(t)= \\begin{cases} B_1(t) ~ \\mbox{for}~t&gt;0,\\\\ B_2(-t) ~\\mbox{for}~ t\\leq 0, \\end{cases}\\] where \\(\\{B_1(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) and \\(\\{B_2(t),~ t \\geq 0\\}\\) are two independent ordinary Brownian motions. Let us note that the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) determines the anomalous diffusion behavior of FBM and \\(\\alpha\\) in the equation (\\[eq1\\]) is equal to \\(2H\\). However, recent empirical findings suggest that classical anomalous diffusion models often fail to adequately capture the underlying dynamics of such phenomena. Consequently, contemporary research has proposed numerous modifications to these models in order to better represent the specific behaviors observed in real data. One such modification involves the incorporation of random parameters that govern anomalous diffusion within traditional models. During the presentation, we introduce a novel conceptual approach to anomalous diffusion modeling, with a particular focus on FBM and its multifractional extension. In these models, the Hurst exponent \\(H\\) is replaced by a suitable randomly chosen variable \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) or a stochastic process \\(\\{\\mathcal{H}(t)\\}\\), respectively. We examine the fundamental probabilistic properties of the models discussed and discuss methodologies for their application to empirical data. The presentation concludes with several illustrative examples based on real-world datasets. The methodology, properties and techniques used for the analysis of the new processes have been published in \\[2,3\\]. Bibliography \\([1]\\) B. B. Mandelbrot and J. W. V.

A natural generalization of the exponential distribution to the matrix-valued setting exists; however, it is not infinitely divisible and therefore cannot be directly used to define a matrix-valued gamma motion, see \\([3]\\). In existing literature, see \\([1]\\), the Lévy–Khintchine representation on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices has been employed to construct infinitely divisible matrix-valued analogues of gamma distributions. In this work, we propose three alternative approaches that yield distinct infinitely divisible distributions on the cone, while retaining the direct use of the natural matrix-valued exponential distribution. The first approach introduces a novel Lévy motion with multivariate argument and thus defined on the non-negative orthant, resulting in a multivariate shape (divisibility) parameter. This construction reveals a simple relationship with the classical matrix gamma distribution, which has a scalar shape parameter. The second and third constructions involve one-dimensional divisibility parameters and can be seen as natural matrix-valued extensions of the Bondesson shot-noise representation of the one-dimensional gamma motion, see \\([2]\\), where the matrix exponential distribution governs the jump sizes. Compared to prior constructions, the proposed models offer advantages such as explicit analytical expressions for many of their properties and straightforward simulation algorithms. These features make the models well-suited for applications in stochastic modeling, especially where stochastic integration is required and both theoretical analysis and computation must remain tractable.

Free probability: Free probability, developed in large part by Voiculescu, is a theory of non-commuting random variables which can be used the describe the large-\\(n\\) behavior of certain \\(n \\times n\\) random matrices. The idea is that the algebra of classical random variables \\(L^\\infty(\\Omega,P)\\) is replaced by a non-commutative von Neumann algebra and the expectation is replaced by a tracial state \\(\\tau: M \\to \\mathbb{C}\\). The role of the normal distribution from classical probability is played by Wigner’s semicircular distribution, and classical independence is replaced by free independence, a condition motivated by free products of groups. In particular, a \\(d\\)-variable free Brownian motion is a process \\(S_t = (S_t^{(1)},\\dots,S_t^{(d)})\\) where the increments are freely independent and the different coordinates are also freely independent. A free Brownian motion describes the large-\\(n\\) behavior of a Brownian motion on the space \\(M_n(\\mathbb{C})_{\\operatorname{sa}}^d\\) of \\(d\\)-tuples of self-adjoint matrices. Stochastic optimization problems: We consider stochastic optimization problems that using both a free Brownian motion \\(S_t\\) and a classical Brownian \\(W_t\\); these processes are thus classical random objects taking values in a tracial von Neumann algebra, equipped with both classical and non-commutative filtrations. We consider processes satisfying \\[dX_t = \\beta_F dS_t + \\beta_C \\,dW_t + \\alpha_t\\,dt,\\] where \\(\\alpha_t\\) is a control that we want to choose. The stochastic optimization problem is \\[\\text{minimize } \\mathbb{E} [\\int_0^1 L(X_t,\\alpha_t)\\,dt + g(X_1)] \\text{ over } \\alpha,\\] where the running cost \\(L\\) and the terminal cost \\(g\\) are given functions that can be evaluated on non-commuting random variables. The inclusion of both \\(S_t\\) and \\(W_t\\) is motivated by mean field game theory (see \\([2]\\)): The \\(S_t\\) represents individual noise associated to a single player (motivated by the Brownian motion that affects all the matrix entries), and the \\(W_t\\) represents a common noise that affects all the players (which in the matrix model would be a random scalar multiple of the identity matrix added to each of the \\(d\\) matrices). Results: We study the value of the minimization problem as a function of the initial condition \\(X_0\\), and show that it satisfies a non-commutative version of the dynamic programming principle and Hamilton–Jacobi equation. A key challenge is that the value of the optimization problem may depend on the choice of ambient von Neumann algebra \\(M\\) and filtration. We thus take the infimum over all choices of \\(M\\) as well, and analyze how to join together different given choices of \\(M\\). However, under certain convexity assumptions, the answer is the same regardless of the choice of \\(M\\), and in this case we can show that the value of the free stochastic optimal problem gives the large-\\(n\\) limit of matrix optimal control problems. We remark that special cases of this setup relate closely with free entropy theory and the large deviation principle of Biane, Capitaine, and Guionnet \\([3]\\).

The performance of the autocovariance function estimator is examined in a simulation study. Finally, the model is applied to a real biomedical dataset. Spectral analysis of harmonizable processes with spectral mass concentrated on lines Bartosz Majewski Harmonizable processes are widely used to model nonstationary signals in fields such as economics, engineering, and medicine. They can be seen as a superposition of sine and cosine waves with random amplitudes. This representation allows us to analyze the dependency between their frequencies. In this context, spectral density and spectral coherence serve as frequency domain analogs of covariance and correlation, respectively. In our research, we focus on harmonizable processes whose spectral measure is concentrated on a union of lines, potentially with non-unit slopes. This class of processes is a generalization of almost periodically correlated processes. It has practical applications in communication, particularly in the location of moving sources such as aircrafts, rockets, or hostile jamming emitters that transmit signals. First, we address the spectral density estimation problem. We propose a periodogram frequency-smoothed along the support line as its estimator. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the rescaled estimator. Consequently, we obtain the asymptotic distribution of the rescaled spectral coherence estimator. In addition, we introduce a subsampling technique designed specifically for the class of processes considered. We establish its consistency and construct subsampling-based confidence intervals for the spectral characteristics of harmonizable processes. To illustrate the theoretical results, we present a simulation study for models commonly used in acoustics and communication. Bibliography \\([1]\\) Dudek, A. E. and Majewski, B.

We first construct an Euler discretization scheme with decreasing time steps. This scheme is similar to those introduced by Lamberton and Pagès in \\[1\\] for a Brownian diffusion and extended by Panloup in \\[2\\] to a diffusion with Lévy jumps. We obtain a non-asymptotic qiasi-Gaussian concentration bound for the difference between the invariant distribution and the empirical distribution computed with the scheme of decreasing time step along appropriate test functions \\(f\\) such that \\(f-\\nu(f)\\) is is a coboundary of the infinitesimal generator.

In this context, \\(\\xi(t)\\) represents a stationary Gaussian process, while \\(g(t)\\) is a deterministic function. The inclusion of the trend function \\(g(t)\\) disrupts stationarity, making it challenging to apply classical results. We provide the normalizing constants \\(a_T\\) and \\(b_T\\) such that \\(a_T(\\max_{t \\in [0,T]} X(t) - b_T)\\) converges to a mixed Gumbel distribution as \\(T \\to \\infty\\). Notably, the normalizing constant \\(a_T\\) appears to be unaffected by the introduction of the trend, whereas the constant \\(b_T\\) is influenced by it. Bibliography \\([1]\\) V. I.

Instead of analyzing second-order summary statistics like the Ripley K-function, one can estimate Bartlett’s spectral measure, also known in physics as the structure factor \\(S\\), which is the Fourier transform of the pair correlation function. Several estimators of \\(S\\) have been introduced \\([1, 2, 3]\\). However, without a reference minimax rate of convergence, it remains unclear whether better estimators could be constructed. We address this gap by proving the following minimax result: for estimating a structure factor of Hölder regularity \\(\\beta\\), the worst-case error of any estimator is at least the expected number of observed points raised to the power \\(-\\beta/(2\\beta + d)\\). We then construct multi-taper estimators that achieve this optimal rate and further show that they exhibit exponential concentration. These estimators are oracle in the sense that they depend on unknown parameters related to the smoothness of \\(S\\). To obtain a practical estimator, we propose a cross-validation method based on random thinning and decorrelation between distinct frequencies. Bibliography \\([1]\\) D. Hawat, G. Gautier, R.

Traditional statistical models often fall short in capturing the nonlinear dynamics and unstructured signals embedded in textual data. This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the LLaMA family, to enhance predictive performance by integrating historical price data with financial news. We compare LLaMA 3.3 with LLaMA 3.1 and a benchmark ARIMA model, evaluating their ability to capture both time series patterns and sentiment-driven signals. Results show that LLaMA 3.3 significantly outperforms the alternatives, confirming the added value of incorporating news sentiment into the forecasting process. The findings underscore the potential of LLM-based approaches to improve market predictions by fusing structured and unstructured data, with implications for traders, analysts, and financial institutions. Future research will focus on domain-specific fine-tuning and enhancing model interpretability.
